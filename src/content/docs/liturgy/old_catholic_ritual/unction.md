UNCTION OF THE SICK.

§ 86. *If the blessed unction is not administered immediately after Confession or Communion, one of those present shall first repeat the general confession of sins* (page 23). *Then shall the Priest say;*

Almighty God have mercy upon thee, forgive thee thy sins, and bring thee to everlasting life.

*Sick person* (*or one of those present*). *Amen*.

*Priest* (*making the sign of the cross*). May the Almighty and merciful Lord grant thee pardon, absolution, and remission of thy sins.

*Sick person*. *Amen*.

§ 90. *Priest* (*laying his right hand on the head of the sick person*).

O Lord God, who hast spoken by thine Apostle James, saying, “Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him:” alleviate, we beseech thee, O our Redeemer, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, the sufferings of this thy servant who is sick; heal his wounds, and forgive his sins, free him from all pains of body and mind, and mercifully restore to him full health inwardly and outwardly; that, being recovered by the help of thy mercy, he may again be able to work in thy service; who with the Father and the Holy Ghost livest and reignest God, world without end. *Amen*.

§ 95. *Then the Priest shall dip his thumb in the holy oil, and anoint the several parts of the body in the form of a cross, saying;*

§ 96. *At the unction of the eyes*.

Through this holy unction +, and through his most tender mercy, the Lord pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed by seeing. *Amen*.

§ 97. *At the unction of the ears*.

Through this holy unction +, and through his most tender mercy, the Lord pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed by hearing. *Amen*.

§ 99. *At the unction of the lips*.

Through this holy unction +, and through his most tender mercy, the Lord pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed with thy mouth. *Amen*.

§ 101. *At the unction of the hands* (*on the inside of the palms*).

Through this holy unction +, and through his most tender mercy, the Lord pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed with thy hands. *Amen*.

§ 102. *At the unction of the feet*.

Through this holy unction + and through his most tender mercy, the Lord pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed in thy walk through life. *Amen*.

§ 104. *The unction of a single eye, ear,* &*c., is sufficient. In cases of extremity the forehead only need be anointed with these words;*

Through this holy unction + and through his most tender mercy, the Lord pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed with the senses of thy body, and with the thoughts and desires of thy heart. *Amen*.

§ 105 *Directly after the unction, the oil shall be wiped off with cotton wool or similar material, which shall afterwards be burned*.

§ 106. *When the unction is finished, the Priest shall say*;

Lord, have mercy upon us.

*Answer*. Christ, have mercy upon us.

*Priest*. Lord, have mercy upon us.

Our Father (*aloud*). *Ans*. *Amen*.

*Priest*. O God, heal thy servant.

*Answer*. Because he hopeth in thee.

*Priest*. Send him help, O Lord, from thy sanctuary.

*Answer*. And defend him out of (the heavenly) Zion.

*Priest*. Be unto him, O Lord, a tower of strength.

*Answer*. Against the face of the enemy.

*Priest*. Lord, hear my prayer.

*Answer*. And let my cry come unto thee.

*Priest*. The Lord be with you.

*Answer*. And with thy spirit

§ 108. *Priest*. Let us pray.

Look down graciously, O Lord, upon this thy servant groaning under severe bodily suffering, and refresh the soul which thou hast created; that being cured of his sickness, he may praise thee as his Saviour; through Christ our Lord. *Amen*.

§ 109. Almighty Father, eternal God, who dost both strike and heal, who sendest sickness and recovery, hear the prayer of faith wherewith we call upon thy name, and raise this sick man up again; that reinstated by thee, he may be restored sound to his and thy holy Church, and may long live safe within it; through Christ our Lord. *Amen*.

§ 110. *Or* (*if there appear small hope of the sick person’s recovery*).

Almighty Father, eternal God, Lord of life and death, hear, as thou hast promised, our prayer of faith, and let it benefit this sick person; forgive him his sins, alleviate his sufferings, and assist him in this hour of trial; strengthen him and us with thy grace, that with humility and resignation he may accept at thy all-merciful hand whatsoever thou impartest, according to thine inscrutable counsels; through Christ our Lord. *Amen*.
