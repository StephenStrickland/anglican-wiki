COMMUNION OF THE SICK.

§ 77, 78. *Unless a private confession of the sick person has immediately preceded, the sick person himself, or one of those present, shall say the general confession* (*p*. 23).

§ 80. *The Communion will be administered with the same forms as in the previous service; but in the case of a sick person in imminent danger of death, the following formulary can be made use of;*

Brother (*or* sister), receive the viaticum of the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which can conduct thee to everlasting life. *Amen*.

§ 82. *It must depend somewhat upon circumstances what prayers the Priest can offer before and after the Communion of the sick person, or can make use of together with others present*. (See Appendix.)
