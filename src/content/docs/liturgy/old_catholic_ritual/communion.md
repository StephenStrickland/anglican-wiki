COMMUNION.

§ 64. *The Holy Communion is, if possible, to be administered during the Mass, after the Communion of the Priest*.

§ 65. *One of the Communicants or the Server shall say aloud;*

I confess to Almighty God, to the Blessed Virgin Mary, to blessed Michael the Archangel, to blessed John the Baptist, to the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, to all the saints, and to you, father, that I have sinned often and exceedingly, in thought, word, and deed, through my fault, my fault, my most grievous fault. Therefore I beseech the Blessed Virgin Mary, blessed Michael the Archangel, blessed John the Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, all the saints, and you, father, to pray to the Lord our God for me.

*Or*,

I confess to God Almighty and to all his beloved saints, to thee the priest of the Lord, and to you, my brethren, that I have sinned often and exceedingly in thought, word, and deed, through my fault, my fault, my most grievous fault. I repent of all my sins, because that by them I have made myself unworthy of the love of God. Trusting in the Lord, who by his cross hath redeemed the world, I humbly intreat the merciful God for forgiveness and remission of my sins.

§ 66. *Priest* (*turning himself toward the communicants*).

Almighty God have mercy upon you, forgive you your sins, and bring you to everlasting life.

*Communicants*. *Amen*.

*Priest* (*making the sign of the cross*).

May the Almighty and merciful Lord grant you pardon, absolution, and remission of your sins.

*Communicants*. *Amen*.

§ 67. *Priest* (*elevating the consecrated host on the ciborium or the paten*).

Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world (*thrice*).

O Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof, but speak the word only and my soul shall be healed.

§ 69. *At the administration of the Communion*.

The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve thy soul unto everlasting life. *Amen*.

§ 70. *If the Communion is not administered during the Mass, the Priest can afterwards add this prayer at the altar:*

O sacred banquet, in which Christ is received, the memory of his passion is brought to our remembrance, our souls are fulfilled with grace, and a pledge of eternal glory is given unto us. (*During Easter-tide*, Alleluia.)

Thou hast given unto us Bread from heaven. (Alleluia.)

*Answer*. Which containeth in itself all sweetness. (Alleluia.)

*Priest*. Lord, hear my prayer.

*Answer*. And let my cry come unto thee.

*Priest*. The Lord be with you.

*Answer*. And with thy spirit.

*Priest*. Let us pray.

O God, who in this wonderful Sacrament hast left us a memorial of thy passion, grant us so to venerate the sacred mysteries of thy Body and Blood, that we may ever feel within ourselves the fruit of thy redemption; who livest and reignest with the Father in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God for ever and ever. *Amen*.

§ 73. *After the Priest has placed the ciborium in the tabernacle, he shall give the blessing with his hand, saying,*

The Blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son +, and the Holy Ghost, be upon yon, and remain with you for ever. *Amen*.
