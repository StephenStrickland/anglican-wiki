CHURCHING OF WOMEN.

§§ 130, 132. *The Priest shall deliver a lighted taper to the woman kneeling on the altar-step, or at a fald-stool, and shall then sprinkle her with holy water, saying;*

May God sprinkle thee with the dew of his grace unto everlasting life.

*Minister*. *Amen*.

*Priest*. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.

My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.

The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in: from this time forth for evermore.

Glory be to the Father, &c. *Minister*. As it was, &c.

§ 133. *Priest*. Lord, have mercy upon us.

*Minister*. Christ, have mercy upon us.

*Priest*. Lord, have mercy upon us.

Our Father (*aloud*).

*Minister*. *Amen*.

*Priest*. O God, save this woman thy servant.

*Minister*. Who putteth her trust in thee.

*Priest*. Send her help, O Lord, from thy sanctuary.

*Minister*. And defend her out of (the heavenly) Sion.

*Priest*. Lord, hear my prayer.

*Minister*. And let my cry come unto thee.

*Priest*. The Lord be with you.

*Minister*. And with thy spirit.

*Priest*. Let us pray.

§ 134. Almighty and everlasting God, look graciously down upon this woman thy servant, who is come (with her child) to thy holy temple, to give thee thanks with a joyful heart, that thou hast stood by her in the hour of peril (and hast granted unto her this child). Continue to take her and her child under thy protection. Illuminate her with the light of thy grace, that she may bring up her child aright in the faith of Christ, the light of the world; and grant that as the child grows in years, it may grow in wisdom, and in favour before God and man, that, when this life is past, they may both obtain the joy of everlasting salvation, by the merits of Jesus Christ, and the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, through Christ our Lord.

*Minister*. *Amen*.

§ 140. *Priest*. The peace and blessing of Almighty God, the Father +, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, descend upon you, and remain with you evermore.

*Minister*. *Amen*.

§ 141. *If the child be not brought into the church, the words in parentheses must be omitted*.

§ 142. *If the child be dead, the following prayer must be used instead of the foregoing:*

§ 143. Let us pray.

Almighty and everlasting God, look graciously down upon this woman thy servant, who is come to thy holy temple to give thee thanks that thou hast stood by her in the hour of peril, and that she can now again take part in the service of God. Continue to take her under thy protection, and send her the light of thy consolation, that with faithful and humble mind she may adore thy wisdom, who hast taken back to thyself the child that thou hast given to her. Grant that when this life is past she may go whither her child is gone on before, even into the joy of everlasting salvation, by the merits of Jesus Christ, and the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, through Christ our Lord.

§ 144. *If the service does not take place in church, the above collect must be altered thus:*

Almighty and everlasting God, look graciously down upon this woman thy servant, who giveth thee thanks that thou hast, &c.
