BLESSING OF HOLY WATER.

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. *Amen*.

Ps. xlii. 1—5.

Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.

2\. My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?

3\. My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God ?

4\. Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;

5\. In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.

§191. *The Priest shall mix a little salt with the water, and shall say;*

The Lord hath said; “Salt is good, but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.” Mindful of these words we mix this salt with the water, as a token that all who devoutly sprinkle themselves with this water, preserve within themselves the salt of Christian wisdom and strength, and should fulfil themselves with the spirit of peace and love. With this intention we consecrate the water, and sign it with the sign of the holy cross +, that the Almighty, who created it, of his boundless mercy may cleanse our hearts from all sin, may fructify them with the rich stream of his grace, and may satisfy their thirst after righteousness with the water of eternal life, through Christ our Lord. *Amen*.

*Priest*. Sprinkle me, O Lord, and I shall be clean.

*Answer*. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

*Priest*. Let us pray.

Almighty Creator, Lord of heaven and earth, who in holy baptism hast made water to be an emblem of the cleansing of our souls; grant, we beseech thee, of thy goodness, to all of us who use this water in enlightened piety and in a Christian spirit, the heavenly water of thy grace, that in accordance with the promise of thy Son our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, there may be within ourselves a well of living water springing up into everlasting life. This we pray thee through the merits of the same thy Son, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, God for ever and ever. *Amen*.
