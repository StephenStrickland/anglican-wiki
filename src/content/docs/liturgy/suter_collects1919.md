FOR QUIET CONFIDENCE

O GOD of peace, who hast taught us that in returning and rest we shall be saved, in quietness and in confidence shall be our strength; By the might of thy Spirit lift us, we pray thee, to thy presence, where we may be still and know that thou art God; through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Isaiah 30. Psalm 46.)

I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

O LORD Jesus Christ, who art the Light of the world; Illumine our hearts, we beseech thee, with the brightness of thy glory, and guide our feet into the way of peace; to the honour of thy holy Name. (St. John 8. Hebrews 1. St. Luke 1.)

I AM THE TRUTH

O GOD, who through our Lord Jesus Christ hast taught us that they who continue in thy word shall know the truth which makes men free; Grant us so faithfully to serve thee that we may be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God; through the same, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. (St. John 8. Romans 8.)

I AM THE TRUE VINE

ALMIGHTY GOD, heavenly Father, whose only Son is the true Vine; Grant us so to abide in him, that being purged of our sins we may plentifully bring forth the fruits of the Spirit; through the same, Jesus Christ our Lord. (St. John 15.)

I AM THE BREAD OF LIFE

ALMIGHTY GOD, who hast sent thy Son from heaven to be the Bread of Life; Grant, we pray thee, that coming to him we may never hunger, and believing on him may never thirst; that so dwelling in him, and he in us, we may have everlasting life; through the same, Jesus Christ our Lord. (St. John 6.)

I AM THE DOOR

ALMIGHTY GOD, whose blessed Son is the Door by whom if any man enter in he shall be saved; Lead us, we pray thee, into thy righteousness, that, entering into thy fold we may not die but live, and evermore give thanks unto thee, whose mercy endureth forever; for the sake of the same, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. (St. John 10. Psalm 118.)

I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD

O LORD Jesus Christ, who art the Good Shepherd, and callest thine own by name; Grant that all men everywhere may hear thy voice and follow thee into the abundant life, that so there may be one flock, and one Shepherd; to the honour and glory of thy Name. (St. John 10.)

I, IF I BE LIFTED UP

ALMIGHTY GOD, whose only-begotten Son was lifted up from the earth; Give us grace, we humbly beseech thee, to seek only the gain of sacrifice, and to strive only for the exaltation of service; that so we may be drawn unto him who by his cross and precious blood hath redeemed us; our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. (St. John 18.)

I AM ALPHA AND OMEGA

O LORD Jesus Christ, who art Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end; Encompass our lives, we pray thee, with thy completeness;, that whether as young men we see visions, or as old men we dream dreams, we may steadfastly look to thee; who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. (Revelation 22. Joel 2.)

FOR INWARD CALM

O LORD Christ, serene Son of God, whose will subdued the troubled waters and laid to rest the fears of men; Let thy majesty master us, thy power of calm control us; that for our fears we may have faith, and for our disquietude perfect trust in thee; who dost live and govern all things, world without end. (St. Luke 8.)

FOR VISION

O GOD, the fulness of whose glory eye hath not seen, nor the heart of man understood; Vouchsafe unto us, we beseech thee, by thine all-searching Spirit, such pureness of heart as may enable our eyes to see the King in his beauty, and to behold the land that is very far off; through Jesus Christ, thy Son, our Lord. (I Corinthians 2. Isaiah 33.)

FOR FAITH

O HEAVENLY Father, who understandest all thy children; Bestow upon us, we beseech thee, thy gift of faith, that we may bring our perplexities to the light of thy wisdom, and receive the blessed encouragement of thy sympathy, and a clearer knowledge of thy will; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

FOR THE GLORY OF SERVANTHOOD

O LORD Jesus Christ, Son of man, who came not to be ministered unto but to minister; Give us grace, we humbly beseech thee, to lay aside the garments of our vanity; and so gird us with thy power, and crown us with thy humility, that finally, in the glory of servanthood we may stand beside thy throne, where with the Father and the Holy Spirit thou reignest, one God, world without end. (St. Matthew 20. St. John 13. St. Matthew 10.)

FOR FULNESS OF LIFE

O GOD, who dost not lack any thing that is good, and who enjoyest the peacefulness of perfect power; Teach us, we pray thee, to fill up the poverty of our souls with thy plentifulness, and to lose our weakness in thy competency; that so we may attain unto the stature of the fulness of thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

FOR THE CROWN OF VICTORY

ALMIGHTY GOD, in whose sight a thousand years pass as a watch in the night; Grant ns to run with patience the race that is set before ns, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before; that so finally by thy mercy we may obtain the crown of everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Psalm 90. Hebrews 12. Philippians 3.)

FOR OUR CHILDREN

O GOD, our heavenly Father, who hast blessed us with the joy and care of children; Give us light and strength so to train them, that they may love whatsoever things are true, and pure, and lovely, and of good report; following the example of their Saviour, Jesus Christ our Lord. (Philippians 4.)

FOR TEACHERS AND LEARNERS

ALMIGHTY GOD, our heavenly Father, who hast committed to thy holy Church the care and nurture of thy children; Enlighten with thy wisdom those who teach and those who learn, that rejoicing in the knowledge of thy truth, they may worship thee and serve thee from generation to generation; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

FOR A SICK CHILD

ALMIGHTY and merciful God, Giver of all power and peace; Watch with us, we beseech thee, over this thy child; walk with him through the valley of sickness, and lead him forth beside the waters of comfort; that he may patiently trust in thy loving-kindness, and abide in thy presence all the days of his life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Psalm 23.)

A PRAYER OF CHILDREN

O LORD Jesus Christ, who hast made us living members of thy Church; Keep us steadfast in faith, obedient to thy voice, and constant in prayer; that we may have power and strength to fight manfully under thy banner, and obtain the victory; to the glory of thy holy Name.

FOR CHILDLIKENESS

O GOD, our Father in heaven, grant us gladness in thy service and humility in thy praise; that in the solemn and blessed remembrance that we are thy children, we may be faithful in duty and worthier of thy love; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

FOR JOY IN GOD'S CREATION

O HEAVENLY FATHER, Who hast filled the world with beauty; Open, we beseech thee, our eyes to behold thy gracious hand in all thy works; that rejoicing in thy whole creation we may learn to serve thee with gladness; for the sake of him by whom all things were made, thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

IN THE MORNING

O HEAVENLY FATHER, of infinite majesty, whom all the earth doth worship, and to whom all angels cry aloud; Govern, we beseech thee, thy people whom thou hast redeemed, and keep us this day without sin, that we may be lifted up forever; through him who hath opened to us the kingdom, thine adorable, true, and only Son, Christ our Lord. (Te Deum.)

CHRISTMAS DAY

O GOD, of heavenly glory, Source of earthly peace and good will; May our Christmas be merry because touched with joy divine; through him who in his purity and love is born in our hearts to-day, thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

A PRAYER OF NATIONS

ALMIGHTY GOD, supreme Governor of all men; Incline thine ear, we beseech thee, to the prayer of nations; and so overrule the imperfect counsel of men, and set straight the things they cannot govern, that we may walk in the paths of obedience to places of vision, and to thoughts that purge and make us wise; through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Woodrow Wilson.)

FOR OUR COUNTRY

ALMIGHTY GOD, Ruler of all the peoples of the earth; Forgive, we beseech thee, our shortcomings as a nation; purify our hearts to see and love the truth; give wisdom to our counselors, and steadfastness to our people; and bring us at last to that fair city of peace whose foundations are mercy, justice, and good-will, and whose Builder and Maker thou art; through thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. (Woodrow Wilson. Hebrews 11.)

THE RED CROSS

ALMIGHTY and merciful God, be present, we pray thee, to those who suffer through war or disaster, that both in their bodies and in their souls they may receive thy healing. Vouchsafe the gifts of thy power to all who go forth under the banner of the Red Cross, that in this sign they may conquer death; stir our hearts to offer in abundance our service and our wealth; and grant that thy people, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

FOR VICTIMS OF DISASTER

ALMIGHTY GOD, for the sake of whose holy child Jesus the children of Bethlehem suffered cruel death; Have mercy, we beseech thee, upon all those who innocently endure grief or pain, suffering wrongfully; and in all their affliction incline thine ear to hear them, and send the angel of thy presence to console and save them; through him who did no sin, but bare our sins in his own body on the tree, thy Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ. (I Peter 2. Isaiah 63.)

FOR THE DYING

O GOD, our heavenly Father, have pity, beseech thee, upon those thy children who in great bodily weakness are drawing near to the gates of death. Send thy dear Son to meet with them in the way, and to abide with them, for the day is far spent; that he may comfort them with a sense of thy goodness, and break with them the bread of eternal life; through the same, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. (St. Luke 24.)

FOR THOSE BEREAVED THROUGH THE WAR

Have compassion, O most merciful Lord, on all who are mourning for those dear to them. Be thou their Comforter and Friend, and bring them to a fuller knowledge of thy love; assuage the anguish of their bereavement, and leave only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and a solemn pride to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Abraham Lincoln.)

DEDICATION OF A SERVICE FLAG

ALMIGHTY GOD, who tellest the number of the stars and callest them all by their names; Accept at our hands, we pray thee, this flag, as a pledge of our devotion to liberty, and a sign of the constancy and valor of our sons; that it may ever remind us of the sacrifice by which alone the world can be redeemed, and which was manifested in thy Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Psalm 147.)
