## PART II.

## THE ORDER OF THE CEREMONIES AT A HIGH CELEBRATION OF THE HOLY EUCHARIST.

### I. Of the General Preparations.

On a table in the Sacristy should be prepared the Vestments, of the colour of the day, for the Celebrant, Deacon and Sub-deacon, in the following order—in the centre, the Chasuble, Stole, Maniple, Girdle, Alb and Amice for the Celebrant; to the right, the Dalmatic (or, if required, the folded Chasuble), Stole, Maniple, Girdle, Alb and Amice for the Deacon; to the left, the Tunicle (or, if required, the folded Chasuble), Maniple, Girdle, Alb and Amice for the Sub-deacon.

Should there be a Solemn Procession before the Celebration, a Cope should be provided for the Celebrant, instead of the Chasuble, and the three Maniples, together with the Chasuble, will be placed on the Sedilia, in the Sanctuary.

At the usual place in the Sacristy, the Thurible, Incense-boat, Acolytes**'** Candlesticks, and the Torches for the Elevation will be placed in readiness.

On the Altar, at the Epistle side, the Missal will be placed on the book-stand, open at the Service of the day, with the markers properly arranged.

On the Credence, the Chalice duly prepared and covered with its Veil and Burse will be placed in the centre, the opening of the Burse being towards the wall; on the right, nearest the Altar, the Cruets with wine and water on their stand, the basin and finger towel; on the left, the Books of Epistles and Gospels, with the markers in the place for the day; and in convenient places (leaving room for the Acolytes**'** Candlesticks, on either side), the Alms Dish and the Ciborium and small bell, if required; the whole being covered with the Humeral Veil of the Sub-deacon. The Breads should be placed in readiness on the Paten or, if there be many, the large Host on the Paten and the small breads in the Ciborium.

### II. Of the use of Incense.

There are two kinds of incensing; one consisting of a single swing of the Thurible towards the object or person to be incensed: the other, of a double swing.

The most Holy Sacrament, the Cross of the Altar, the Book of the Gospels, a Bishop in his diocese,[\[1\]](#_ftn1) the Archbishop throughout his province and the Celebrant or Officiating Priest[\[2\]](#_ftn2) are incensed with three double swings.

The Canons of a Cathedral; the principal assistants of a Bishop; the Deacon and Sub-deacon at the Holy Eucharist; the principal Priest of a Church, without Canons; and the Assistants in Copes at Evensong are incensed with two double swings.

All Priests in choir are incensed with one double swing. If they be numerous, they may be incensed collectively, first those on one side of the Chancel and then those on the other. If they be incensed individually, attention must be paid to the order of their dignity. The Choir will be incensed collectively, first those on one side of the Chancel and then those on the other, with a single swing of the Thurible.

The Master of the Ceremonies, Acolytes and people are each incensed with a single swing of the Thurible. The people in the centre of the Church are incensed first, then those on the Epistle side and lastly those on the Gospel side.

When about to incense with a double swing, he who is to incense will hold in his left hand the top of the chains of the Thurible, below the holder to which they are attached, and in his right, the lower part of the chains about two inches above the cover; he raises the Thurible towards the object or person to be incensed and gives it a very slight impulsion forward and then a second, but more marked, impulsion in the same direction. Lowering the Thurible towards his right, he repeats the same a second or a third time as may be necessary.

When about to incense with a single swing, the person using it, holding the Thurible as before, will raise it to nearly the height of his own face, giving it a slight impulsion towards the object or person to be incensed. If it be necessary to give a second or third swing, the Thurible must be first lowered, as when giving double swings.

The persons to be incensed should be saluted with an inclination of the head both before and after being incensed, but neither the head nor the body should be moved while engaged in incensing.

The Thurifer should carry the Incense-boat unless a sanctuary-boy be provided for that purpose.

He then proceeds to incense the Table of the Altar on the Epistle side with three swings (4, 5, 6), measuring in the act equal distances and walking in such a manner as to accompany each step with a swing of the Thurible—usually a swing is made towards each of the three Candlesticks. Arrived at the corner of the Altar, the Celebrant lowers his hand and incenses the lower part with one swing (7) and the upper, with another (8); then raising his hand and turning round, he incenses the Table of the Altar with three swings (9, 10, 11) as far as the centre, where having returned, he makes the proper reverence and then proceeds to incense the Gospel side with three swings (12, 13, 14) and the lower and upper parts of the Gospel corner with two swings (15, 16), as on the Epistle side. Without changing his position, he raises his hand and incenses the upper part of the Table, towards the centre of the Altar, with three swings (17, 18, 19); again lowering his hand, he incenses with three swings (20, 21, 22) the front part of the Altar on the Gospel side, walking as he does so towards the centre; arrived there, he makes the proper reverence and proceeding, incenses with three swings (23, 24, 25) the front of the Epistle side, as far as the corner.</p><p>All the movements of the Thurible in the incensing of the Altar will be single swings, with the exception of those to the Cross which should be double.</p></td><td valign="top" width="17%"><p><b>5.</b>—While the Celebrant incenses the Altar, he stands at his right, raises the Chasuble with his left hand, the right being placed upon his breast, and makes, with the Celebrant, the proper reverence when they pass the centre of the Altar.</p></td><td valign="top" width="17%"><p><b>5.</b>—After the blessing of the incense, he again turns to the Altar and while the Celebrant is making the incensings, he raises the Chasuble with his right hand, the left being placed upon his breast, and makes with the Celebrant, the proper reverence when they pass the centre of the Altar.</p></td><td valign="top" width="17%"><p>AT THE BLESSING OF INCENSE.</p><p align="center"><a href="images/p057-1.jpg"><img alt="At the blessing of the incense 1" border="0" height="96" src="images/p057-1th.jpg" width="100"></a></p><p align="center"><a href="images/p057-2.jpg"><img alt="At the blessing of the incense 2" border="0" height="97" src="images/p057-2th.jpg" width="100"></a></p><p>Note.—<i>If the predella of the Altar be narrow</i>, <i>the positions given in the second diagram should be adopted.</i></p><p>NOTE.—THE POSITION OF THE LETTERS IN THE DIAGRAMS INDICATES THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE RESPECTIVE MINISTERS SHOULD FACE.</p></td><td valign="top" width="16%"><p> </p></td><td valign="top" width="16%"><p> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="17%"><p><b>6.</b>—At the Epistle corner, he presents the Thurible to the Deacon and is himself incensed, standing with hands joined and facing south.

[\[4\]](#_ftnref4) *Vide* Note 3 on preceding page.

[\[5\]](#_ftnref5) If the Sacred Ministers do not go to sit down during the Creed, they will make an inclination of the head to the Cross while the Choir sing the words *came down from Heaven*, and then descend a step and kneel upon the predella, while the *Incarnatus est* is being sung. The Deacon will then proceed to the Credence for the Burse and spread the Corporal on the Altar, as directed on page 66.

[\[6\]](#_ftnref6) If the Celebrant does not sit during the singing of the Creed, he will proceed to do so, as above directed, at its conclusion for the Sermon, or if there be none, he will go on at once to the Offertory, unless there are some Notices to be announced to the people.
