## THE PRAYERS FOR CELEBRANT AND SACRED MINISTERS AT THE HOLY EUCHARIST, WITH SOME BRIEF DIRECTIONS.

### (For the Prayers to be said while vesting, *vide* pp. 31, 52).

*The Priest*, *standing at the foot of the Altar*, *signs himself with the Sign of the Cross*, *and says*:

\+ In the Name of the FATHER, and of the SON, and of the HOLY GHOST. Amen.

*Then*, *joining his hands before his breast*, *he begins the Antiphon*:

I will go unto the Altar of GOD.

*Server*.—Even unto the GOD of my joy and gladness.

\[*At a High Celebration*, *the foregoing and subsequent responses in the preparatory prayers are said by the Sacred Ministers and other Assistants*, *in place of the Server*.\]

(*The following Psalm and the repetition of the Antiphon are omitted in Requiems*, *and from Passion Sunday till Maundy Thursday inclusive*.)

Psalm xliii. *Judica*.

*P*.—Give sentence with me, O GOD, and defend my cause against the ungodly people: O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.

*S*.—For Thou art the GOD of my strength, why hast Thou put me from Thee: and why go I so heavily while the enemy oppresseth me ?

*P.*—O send out Thy light and Thy truth that they may lead me: and bring me unto Thy holy hill, and to Thy dwelling.

*S*.—And that I may go unto the Altar of GOD, even unto the GOD of my joy and gladness: and upon the harp will I give thanks unto Thee, O GOD, my GOD.

*P.*—Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me ?

*S.*—O put thy trust in GOD, for I will yet give Him thanks: which is the help of my countenance and my GOD.

*P.*—Glory be to the FATHER, and to the SON, and to the HOLY GHOST.

*S.*—As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

*P.*—I will go unto the Altar of GOD.

*S.*—Even unto the GOD of my joy and gladness.

*Making the Sign of the Cross upon himself*, *he says*:

*P.*— + Our help is in the Name of the LORD.

*S.*—Who hath made Heaven and earth.

*Bowing down*, *he says the Confession*:

I CONFESS to Almighty GOD, to blessed Mary ever-Virgin, to blessed Michael the Archangel, to blessed John Baptist, to the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, to all the Saints, and to you, brethren, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed, (*he strikes his breast thrice*) through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore I beg blessed Mary ever-Virgin, blessed Michael the Archangel, blessed John Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, all the Saints, and you, brethren, to pray to the LORD our GOD for me.

*S.*—May Almighty GOD have mercy upon thee, forgive thee thy sins and bring thee to everlasting life,

*P.*—Amen.

\[page 106\]

*The Server at once says the Confession*, *saying* you father, *in place of the words* you brethren *when they occur*.

*Then the Priest gives the Absolution*, *saying*:

May Almighty GOD have mercy . . . . everlasting life.

*S.*—Amen.

*P.*— + May the Almighty and Merciful LORD grant us pardon, absolution and remission of our sins.

*S.*—Amen.

*P.*—Wilt Thou not turn again, and quicken us, O LORD ?

*S.*—That Thy people may rejoice in Thee.

*P.*—Show us Thy mercy, O LORD.

*S.*—And grant us Thy salvation.

*P.*—O LORD, hear my prayer.

*S.*—And let my cry come unto Thee.

*P.*—The LORD be with you.

*S.*—And with thy spirit.

*P.*—Let us pray.

*As he ascends to the Altar*, *the Priest says*:

WE beseech Thee, O LORD, to take away from us our iniquities: that we may be worthy to enter with pure minds into the Holy of holies. Through CHRIST our LORD. Amen.

*Bowing down and kissing the Altar*, *he says*:

WE beseech Thee, O LORD, by the merits of all Thy Saints, that Thou wouldest vouchsafe to forgive me all my sins. Amen.

*He then makes the Sign of the Cross upon himself*, *and reads the Introit*. (*In Requiems*, *the Priest makes the Sign of the Cross over the Book and not upon himself*.)

\[*At a High Celebration*, *the Thurible is brought to the Celebrant before he reads the Introit*. *The Deacon says* Bless, reverend father, *and the Priest*, *as he puts in the Incense says*: Be thou blessed of Him in Whose honour thou art to be burned. Amen. *He afterwards makes the Sign of the Cross over the Thurible and then incenses the Altar*. *After being incensed by the Deacon*, *he makes the Sign of the Cross upon himself and then reads the Introit*. *In Requiems*, *Incense is not used before the Offertory*.\]

*The* Kyries *are thus said*:

*P.*—LORD, have mercy. *S.*—LORD, have mercy.
*P.*—LORD, have mercy. *S.*—CHRIST, have mercy.
*P.*—CHRIST, have mercy. *S.*—CHRIST, have mercy.
*P.*—LORD, have mercy. *S.*—LORD, have mercy.
*P.*—LORD, have mercy.

*After the Epistle*, *Gradual*, *etc*., *the Priest goes to the centre*, *and bowing profoundly*, *says*:

CLEANSE my heart and my lips, O Almighty GOD, as Thou didst cleanse the lips of the Prophet Isaiah, with a live coal: of Thy Gracious Mercy vouchsafe so to cleanse me, that I may worthily proclaim Thy Holy Gospel. Through CHRIST our LORD. Amen.

GIVE me, O LORD, Thy blessing: The LORD be in my heart and upon my lips, that I may worthily and fitly proclaim His Gospel. Amen.

(*The last Prayer is omitted in Requiems*.)

\[page 107\]

*Going to the Gospel corner and facing the Book he says with hands joined*, The LORD be with you. R/. And with thy spirit. *He makes the Sign of the Cross on the Book and then on his forehead*, *mouth*, *and breast*, *saying*, The Holy Gospel is written in the — chapter of the Holy Gospel according to Saint ————, beginning at the — verse. R/. Glory be to Thee, O LORD.

*After the Gospel*, *the Server responds*, Praise be to Thee, O CHRIST. *Then*, *except in Requiems*, *the Celebrant kisses the Book and says*, Through the words of the Gospel, may our sins be blotted out. *He returns to the centre for the Creed*.

\[*At a High Celebration*, *during the Gradual*, *etc*., *the Deacon places the Book of the Gospels on the Altar at the centre and there remains until the Celebrant arrives*. *The Celebrant blesses the Incense as before*, *and the Deacon then kneels and says the prayer*. Cleanse my heart, etc., *as above*. *Afterwards he takes the Book from the Altar*, *and again kneeling*, says, Give me, O LORD, thy blessing. *The Celebrant turns towards him and says*, The LORD be in thy heart and upon thy lips, tat thou mayest worthily and fitly proclaim His Gospel: in the Name of the FATHER, and of the SON and + of the HOLY GHOST. Amen. *The Deacon kisses the hand of the Priest and proceeds to the place where the Gospel is to be sung*. *Arrived*, *he gives the Book to the Sub-Deacon and*, *standing with his hands joined*, *says*, The LORD be with you. R/. And with thy spirit. *He then announces the Gospel in the manner directed above*, *and while the* R/. *is being said*, *incenses the Book three times*, *and then sings the Gospel*. *At the conclusion is said*, Praise be to Thee, O CHRIST, *as usual*, *the Sub-Deacon carries the Book to the Celebrant*, *who kisses it and is then incensed by the Deacon*.\]

*After the Creed* (*and the Sermon*, *if there be one*), *the Priest kisses the Altar*, *and turning to the people*, *says*: The LORD be with you. R/. And with thy spirit. *Then he says*, Let us pray, *and reads the Offertory*.

*After he has read the Offertory*, *he takes the Paten with the Bread*, *and offering it*, *says*:

RECEIVE, O HOLY FATHER, Almighty and Eternal GOD, this spotless Host, which I, Thine unworthy servant, offer unto Thee, my GOD, the Living and the True, for my numberless sins, offences, and negligences; for all here present, and for all faithful Christians, both living and departed; that it may avail to me and to them for salvation unto everlasting life. Amen.

*When the Wine has been poured into the Chalice he makes the Sign of the Cross over the Water Cruet*, *and says this Prayer*:

\+ O GOD, Who didst wonderfully create, and yet more wonderfully renew the dignity of the nature of man: grant that, by the mystery of this Water and Wine, we may be made partakers of His Divinity, Who vouchsafed to become partaker of our humanity, JESUS CHRIST, Thy SON, our LORD; Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the Unity of the HOLY GHOST, GOD, world without end. Amen.

(*In Requiems the Water is not blessed*, *but the Prayer is said as usual*.)

*Then he takes the Chalice and offers it*, *saying*:

WE offer unto Thee, O LORD, the Cup of Salvation, humbly beseeching Thy Mercy: that in the sight of Thy Divine Majesty it may ascend as a sweet-smelling savour for our salvation, and for that of the whole world. Amen.

*Having placed the Chalice upon the Altar*, *and covered it with the Pall*, *he says*:

IN the spirit of humility and with a contrite heart, let us be accepted of Thee, O LORD; and so let our Sacrifice be offered in Thy Sight this day, that it may be well-pleasing unto Thee, O LORD GOD.

COME, O Sanctifier, Almighty, Eternal GOD, and bl+ess this Sacrifice prepared for Thy Holy Name.

\[page 108\]

\[*At a High Celebration*, *he then blesses the Incense*, *saying*:

AT the intercession of blessed Michael the Archangel standing at the right hand of the Altar of Incense, and of all His Elect, may the LORD vouchsafe to bl+ess this Incense and receive it as an odour of sweetness. Through CHRIST our LORD. Amen.

*Then he incenses the Oblations*, *saying*:

MAY this Incense which Thou hast blessed, ascend to Thee, O LORD, and may there descend upon us Thy mercy.

*Then while incensing the Altar*, *he says*:

LET my prayer, O LORD, be set forth in Thy Sight as the Incense: and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.

Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips. O let not my heart be inclined to any evil thing.

*Giving the Thurible to the Deacon*, *he says*:

MAY the LORD enkindle in us the fire of His love, and the flame of everlasting charity. Amen.

*He is afterwards incensed by the Deacon*. *The Deacon then proceeds to incense the Clergy*, *etc*., *but does not do so in Requiems*.\]

*The Priest at the Epistle side of the Altar*, *washes his hands*, *saying*:

I WILL wash my hands in innocency, O LORD: and so will I go to Thine Altar.

That I may shew the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all Thy wondrous works.

LORD, I have loved the habitation of Thy house: and the place where Thine honour dwelleth.

O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty;

In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.

But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.

My foot standeth right: I will praise the LORD in the congregations.

Glory be, etc. As it was, etc.

(*The* Gloria Patri *is not said in Requiems*, *nor from Passion Sunday till Maundy Thursday inclusive*.)

*Having returned to the midst of the Altar*, *he says*:

RECEIVE, O HOLY TRINITY, this Oblation, which we offer unto Thee, in memory of the Passion, Resurrection and Ascension of our LORD JESUS CHRIST: and in honour of blessed Mary ever-Virgin, of blessed John the Baptist, of the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, of these and all Saints: that it may avail to their honour, and to our salvation: and let them, whose memory we celebrate on earth, vouchsafe to intercede for us in Heaven. Through the Same CHRIST our LORD. Amen.

*Then the Priest*, *kisses the Altar*, *turns towards the people*, *and says*:

BRETHREN, pray (*completing the circle*, *he continues*) that this my Sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to GOD the FATHER Almighty.

*The Deacon or Server shall answer*, *or the Priest himself shall say*:

LORD receive the Sacrifice at thy (*or* my) hands, to the praise and glory of His Name, to our benefit and that of all His Holy Church. R/. Amen.

\[page 109\]

*Then follow the Secret Prayers*, *in the same number and in the same order as the Collects*.

*At the end of the last he says in an audible voice*, world without end *and the Server responds*, Amen.

*After the* Sanctus, *the Priest makes the Sign of the Cross upon himself and says*:

\+ Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the LORD. Hosanna in the Highest.

*Standing before the midst of the Altar*, *he says*:

THEE therefore, O most Merciful FATHER, through JESUS CHRIST, Thy SON, our LORD, we most humbly pray and beseech, (*he kisses the Altar*) that Thou wouldest vouchsafe to accept and to bless these + Gifts, these + Offerings, these holy + and unspotted Sacrifices, which we offer unto Thee in the first place for Thy Holy Catholic Church; that Thou wouldest be pleased to keep it in peace, to preserve, unite and govern it throughout the world; and also for Thy servant our Primate N., our Bishop N., and for all true believers, and those worshipping in the Catholic and Apostolic Faith.

*Commemoration of the Living.*
BE mindful, O LORD, of Thy servants and handmaids N.,and N., and of all here present, whose faith Thou perceivest, and whose devotion Thou knowest, for whom we offer unto Thee, or who themselves offer unto Thee, this Sacrifice of Praise, for themselves, and for all to whom they are bound, for the redemption of their souls, for the hope of their safety and salvation; and who pay their vows unto Thee the Eternal GOD, the Living and the True.

JOINING in communion with, (1) and reverencing in the first place, the memory of the glorious and ever-Virgin Mary, Mother of our GOD and LORD JESUS CHRIST; as also of Thy blessed Apostles and Martyrs, Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, John, Thomas, James, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon and Thaddeus, Linus, Cletus, Clement, Xystus, Cornelius, Cyprian, Laurence, Chrysogonus, John and Paul, Cosmas and Damian, and of all Thy Saints; for whose merits and prayers do Thou grant that in all things we may be defended by the help of Thy protection. Through the Same CHRIST our LORD. Amen.

WHICH Oblation do Thou, O GOD, we beseech Thee, vouchsafe in all respects, to make bless+ed, approv+ed, ratify+ed, reasonable, and acceptable; that it may become unto us the Bo+dy and Blo+od of Thy most dearly-beloved SON, JESUS CHRIST our LORD.

*If there be a Ciborium*, *he will now uncover it and place it in front of the Chalice*.

*From the Saturdays before Easter and Pentecost to the following Saturdays*:—which we offer unto Thee for those also, whom Thou hast vouchsafed to regenerate by water and the HOLY GHOST, granting them the remission of all their sins, we beseech, &c.

\[page 111\]

*Standing upright*, *with hands extended*, *he proceeds*:

WHEREFORE, O LORD, we Thy servants, together with all Thy holy people, having in remembrance the blessed Passion of the Same CHRIST Thy SON our LORD, as also His Resurrection from the dead, and His glorious Ascension into Heaven, do offer unto Thy most excellent Majesty, of Thine own Gifts bestowed upon us, a Pure + Sacrifice, a Holy + Sacrifice, a Spotless + Sacrifice, the Holy + Bread of Eternal Life, and the Cup + of Everlasting Salvation. Upon which vouchsafe to look with a favourable and gracious countenance; and to accept them, even as Thou wast pleased to accept the gifts of Thy righteous servant Abel, and the sacrifice of our Patriarch Abraham, and that holy sacrifice, that spotless offering, which Thy High Priest Melchisedec offered unto Thee.

*Bowing profoundly*, *with hands joined upon the Altar*, *he says*:

WE most humbly beseech Thee, Almighty GOD, command that these Oblations be borne by the hands of Thy holy Angel to Thine Altar on high, before the presence of Thy Divine Majesty: that so many of us as are partakers at this Altar (*he kisses the Altar*) and receive the most Sacred Bo+dy and Blo+od of Thy SON, may be filled with all heavenly Bene+diction and Grace. Through the Same CHRIST our LORD. Amen.

*Commemoration of the Departed.*
BE mindful also, O LORD, of Thy servants and handmaids N., and N., who have gone before us, with the sign of faith, and rest in the sleep of peace. To these, O LORD, and to all that rest in CHRIST, grant, we beseech Thee, a place of refreshment, light and peace. Through (*he bows his head*) the Same CHRIST our LORD. Amen.

TO us, also, (*he strikes his breast*) Thy sinful servants, trusting in the multitude of Thy mercies, vouchsafe to grant some part and fellowship with Thy holy Apostles and Martyrs; with John, Stephen, Matthias, Barnabas, Ignatius, Alexander, Marcellinus, Peter, Felicitas, Perpetua, Agatha, Lucy, Agnes, Cecilia, Anastasia, and with all Thy Saints; into whose company we beseech Thee to admit us, not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences. Through CHRIST our LORD. By Whom, O LORD, Thou dost ever create all these good things, sancti+fy, quick+en, bl+ess, and bestow them upon us. (*He uncovers the Chalice and genuflects*. *Rising*, *He takes the Host and with It makes three Signs of the Cross within the Chalice*.) By + Him, and with + Him, and in + Him, be unto Thee, (*he makes two other Signs of the Cross between the Chalice and himself*) O GOD, the FATHER + Almighty, in the Unity of the HOLY + GHOST, (*he places the Host over the Chalice and elevates both together while saying*) all honour and glory, (*then replaces them*, *covers the Chalice and genuflects*. *Rising again*, *he says*) world without end. R/. Amen.

Let us pray.

INSTRUCTED by saving precepts, and following Divine institution, we presume to say

Our FATHER.

R/. But deliver us from evil. *Priest*. Amen.

*Taking the Paten*, *he holds it upright on the Altar*, *saying*:

DELIVER us, O LORD, we beseech Thee, from all evils, past, present, and to come: and at the intercession of the blessed and glorious Mary, ever-Virgin, Mother of GOD, with that of Thy blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and Andrew, and of all Saints, graciously grant peace (*he makes the Sign of the Cross upon himself with the Paten*, *then kisses it and places it under the Host*) in our time: that by the help of Thy mercy we may be ever set free from sin, and safe from all distress. (*He uncovers the Chalice*, *genuflects and then takes the Host and breaks It in half*, *while saying*) Through the Same JESUS CHRIST, Thy SON, our LORD, (*he sets down the Part in his right hand and from the Part in his left hand*, *breaks off a small Particle*, *saying*) Who liveth and reigneth with Thee, (*he holds the small Particle over the Chalice with his right hand and puts down the remainder*) in the Unity of the HOLY GHOST, ever One GOD, (he takes the Chalice by the knob with his left hand, saying) world without end. R/. Amen.

\[page 112\]

*He makes three Signs of the Cross over the Chalice with the small Particle of the Host*.

THE Peace + of the LORD be + always with + you. R/. And with thy spirit.

*Then placing the Particle of the Host in the Chalice*, *he says*,

LET this commixture and consecration of the Body and Blood of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, be to us that partake thereof effectual unto everlasting life. Amen.

*He covers the Chalice and makes a genuflection*. *Rising and bowing down*, *he says twice*,

O LAMB of GOD, That takest away the sins of the world: have mercy upon us. *And then*,

O LAMB of GOD, That takest away the sins of the world: grant us Thy peace.

*The Priest strikes his breast three times while saying the above*, *except in Requiems when he says twice*,

O LAMB of GOD, That takest away the sins of the world: grant them rest. *And then*,

O LAMB of GOD, That takest away the sins of the world: grant them rest everlasting.

*Bowing down*, *with hands joined upon the Altar*, *he says*,

O LORD JESU CHRIST, Who saidst to Thy Apostles, Peace I leave with you, My Peace I give unto you; regard not my sins, but the faith of Thy Church: and grant to her that peace and unity which is agreeable to Thy Will. Who livest and reignest, GOD, world without end. Amen.

(*The foregoing Prayer is omitted in Requiems*.)

O LORD JESU CHRIST, son of the living GOD, Who, according to the Will of the FATHER, and by the Co-operation of the HOLY GHOST, hast by Thy Death given life to the world; deliver me, I beseech Thee, by This Thy most Sacred Body and Blood, from all mine iniquities, and from every evil, and make me ever to cleave unto Thy commandments, and suffer me never to be separated from Thee. Who with the Same GOD the FATHER, and the HOLY GHOST, livest and reignest GOD, world without end. Amen.

LET the partaking of Thy Body, O LORD JESU CHRIST, which I, although unworthy, presume to receive, turn not to my judgment and condemnation: but according to Thy loving-kindness let it be profitable unto me for the receiving of protection and healing, both of body and soul. Who with GOD the FATHER, in the Unity of the HOLY GHOST, livest and reignest GOD, world without end. Amen.

*The Priest genuflects and while rising*, *says*:

I WILL receive the Bread of Heaven, and call upon the Name of the LORD.

*Striking his breast*, *he says thrice*:

LORD, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof; but speak the word only, and my soul shall be healed.

*Then let him make the Sign of the Cross with the Host*, *saying*:

THE Body of our LORD JESUS CHRIST preserve my soul unto everlasting life. Amen.

*After which he reverently receives*.

*Then uncovering the Chalice*, *he says*:

WHAT reward shall I give unto the LORD for all the benefits that He hath done unto me? (*he genuflects and takes the Chalice*) I will receive the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the LORD. I will call upon the LORD Which is worthy to be praised, so shall I be safe from mine enemies.

*He makes the Sign of the Cross with the Chalice*, *and says*:

THE Blood of our LORD JESUS CHRIST preserve my soul unto everlasting life. Amen.

*He then reverently receives the Precious Blood*, *puts down the Chalice in its place*, *covers it and makes a genuflection*. *If there be a Ciborium he brings it forward and uncovers it*, \[page 113\] *or else collects and places the Particles on the Paten*; *he then genuflects again and rising*, *takes the Paten or Ciborium*. *Taking a Particle and raising It a little over the Paten or Ciborium*; *he turns to the people and says*: Behold the LAMB of GOD, behold Him That taketh away the sins of the world, *and then repeats three times as before*, LORD, I am not worthy, etc. *He descends the steps and administers the Holy Communion* (vide pages 41-42).

*When presenting the Chalice to the Server to receive the Wine for the first Ablution*, *he says*:

GRANT, O LORD, that what we have taken with our lips we may receive with a pure mind: and may this temporal gift be to us an everlasting remedy.

*Before taking the Second Ablution*.

MAY Thy Body, O LORD, Which I have received, and Thy Blood, Which I have drunk, cleave to me; and grant that no stain of sin may remain in me, who have been refreshed by pure and holy Sacraments. Who livest and reignest world without end. Amen.

*Having received the Ablutions*, *dried and covered the Chalice*, *and replaced it on the Altar as at first*, *he goes to the Book and reads the Communion*. *Then he goes to the centre*, *kisses the Altar*, *turns to the people and says*: The LORD be with you.

R/. And with thy spirit.

*Returning to the Book*, *he reads the Post Communions in the same number and order as the Collects*; *at the end of the first and last the Server responds*, Amen.

*Then if the Ablutions have been deferred till after the Benediction*, *the Priest goes at once to the Gospel side and reads the Last Gospel* (vide p. 44 and below). *But if the Ablutions have been taken immediately after the Communion of the people*, *here will follow the* LORD’s Prayer, *and the following Prayer*, *which are said at the Epistle side*, *the Priest then goes to the centre for the* Gloria in Excelsis, *if it be said*, *after which*, *standing in the same place*, *he says*, *bowing down and with hands joined upon the Altar*:

O MOST HOLY TRINITY, grant that this my bounden duty, and service, may be pleasing unto Thee, and that this Sacrifice, which I, unworthy, have offered in the Sight of Thy Majesty, may be acceptable unto Thee, and, through Thy mercy, obtain Thy gracious favour for myself, and all for whom I have offered It. Through CHRIST our LORD. Amen. (*He kisses the Altar and then*, *except in Requiems*, *gives the Benediction*.)

NOTE.— *This Prayer*, *in any case*, *will always be said immediately before the Benediction* (vide p. 42).

*Arrived at the Gospel corner he says with hands joined*, The LORD be with you. R/. And with thy spirit. *He makes the Sign of the Cross on the Altar or on the Book*, *and then on his forehead*, *mouth and breast*, *saying*, The beginning of the Holy Gospel according to S. John (*or*, The continuation of the Holy Gospel according to S. *N*., *if a Proper Gospel be read*). R/. Glory be to Thee, O LORD.

IN the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with GOD, and the WORD was god. The Same was in the beginning with GOD. All things were made by Him: and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men. And the Light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from GOD, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of GOD, even to them that believe on His Name; which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of GOD. (*He genuflects towards the Gospel side*.) AND THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the FATHER,) full of grace and truth. R/. Thanks be to GOD.
