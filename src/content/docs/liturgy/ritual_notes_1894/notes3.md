## SPECIAL DUTIES OF THE MINISTERS AT SOLEMN REQUIEMS.

CELEBRANT. At Solemn Services, in addition to the variations prescribed on p. 18, the Celebrant will not at any time present his hand to be kissed and does not bless or use incense at the Introit or before the Gospel. He does not bless the Sub-deacon after the Epistle or the Deacon before the Gospel. If the *Dies Irae* be sung after the Tract, the Celebrant having read it, at the Altar, may proceed with the Sacred Ministers, to sit down in the usual manner but will return to the Altar in sufficient time to say the prayer *Cleanse my heart*, *&c*., and to read the Gospel before the Choir shall have concluded the singing. After the Gospel, the Sub-deacon does not present the Book to the Celebrant to be kissed.

The Creed should not be sung. After the Oblations have been offered, incense is blessed and the Oblations, Altar and Celebrant are incensed as usual.

The *Gloria in Excelsis* and the Benediction should be omitted and when the Deacon sings the V/. *May they rest in peace*, the Celebrant will also say it in an undertone, with his face turned towards the Altar, and always in the plural number.

DEACON. After the preparatory prayers, when the Celebrant ascends to the Altar, the Deacon will place himself behind him, on the step below the predella and when he goes to the Missal will proceed to the side with him and assist, as usual, at the Introit, but he does not make the Sign of the Cross, at the commencement. The incensing of the Altar is omitted.

The Deacon at the usual time, carries the Book of Gospels to the Altar, and having placed it thereon, kneels to say the prayer *Cleanse my heart*, *&c*., but does not ask the Celebrant’s blessing, or kiss his hand. Incense is not used at the Gospel.

As the Creed is not sung, the Deacon does not spread the Corporal until the Offertory, when the Sub-deacon brings the Chalice covered with the Veil and Burse to the Altar. The Deacon takes the Burse and extends the Corporal as usual and then presents the Oblations to the Celebrant in the ordinary manner. After the offering of the Chalice, the Deacon does not give the Paten to the Sub-deacon but places it partly under the Corporal and covers the remainder with the Purificator, as at a Low Celebration (*vide* p. 35). Incense is blessed, as usual, but the Deacon does not kiss the spoon, the Thurible or the Celebrant’s hand, and after the incensing of the Oblations and Altar, he incenses the Celebrant only, and, at once, returns the Thurible to the Thurifer. He then receives the towel from the first Acolyte and with the Sub-deacon, ministers at the washing of the Celebrant’s hands; having returned the towel to the Acolyte, he goes to his usual place in the centre, behind the Celebrant.

The Deacon ascends to the Celebrant’s right at the words *And forgive us our trespasses* in the LORD’s Prayer, and presents the Paten to the Celebrant as usual.

The Deacon does not strike his breast at the *Agnus Dei* and at its conclusion, genuflects and changes places with the Sub-deacon, again genuflecting on arriving at the Celebrant’s left.

At the conclusion of the Service, the Deacon sings *May they rest in peace* with his face turned towards the Altar and always in the plural number.

SUB-DEACON. After the preparatory prayers, when the Celebrant ascends to the Altar, the Sub-deacon will place himself behind the Deacon, on the step below, and goes with him to assist at the Introit as usual, but does not make the Sign of the Cross at the commencement. After the Epistle, he does not present \[page 85\] himself to the Celebrant for his blessing but consigns the Book to the Master of Ceremonies, after having made the usual reverence to the Altar. After the Gospel, the Sub-deacon does not carry the Book to the Celebrant to be kissed, but hands it the Master of Ceremonies at once.

As the Creed is not sung, the Sub-deacon, at the Offertory, proceeds to the Credence and takes the Chalice with its Veil and Burse and conveys them to the Epistle side of the Altar. When the Deacon has taken the Burse, he removes the Veil and hands it to the second Acolyte. He presents the Paten with the Breads to the Deacon and purifies the Chalice as usual. When the Deacon has put in the wine, the Sub-deacon pours in the water, without presenting it for the Celebrant’s blessing. Having returned the Cruets to the Acolytes, he passes to the Celebrant’s left hand and assists at the blessing of incense and at the incensing, in the usual way (*vide* Nos 4-6, pp. 56-58).

After the incensing of the Celebrant, the Sub-deacon receives the Water Cruet and dish from the second Acolyte, and, with the Deacon, ministers at the washing of the Celebrant’s hands; having returned the Cruet and dish to the Acolyte, he goes to his place in the centre, behind the Deacon.

All proceeds as usual, until the Deacon passes to the right of the Celebrant, at the words, *Hear us*, *O merciful Father*, and then the Sub-deacon, having made the proper reverence, goes to the lowest step at the Epistle corner and kneels with his face towards the Gospel side. Incense having been placed in the Thurible by the Master of Ceremonies as usual, the Sub-deacon receives it from the Thurifer and incenses the Blessed Sacrament with three double swings at each Elevation. After the Elevations, he returns the Thurible to the Thurifer, rises and proceeds to his usual place in the centre, he genuflects on arrival, and remains standing there. He does not go up to the Altar with the Deacon in the LORD’s Prayer but just before the *Agnus Dei*, he genuflects and ascends to the Celebrant’s left. He says the *Agnus Dei* with the Celebrant but does not strike his breast, and at its conclusion genuflects and, at once, changes places with the Deacon, again genuflecting on arriving at the Celebrant’s right. The remainder of the Service is as usual.

MASTER OF CEREMONIES. The Humeral Veil will not be required on the Credence. The Sign of the Cross at the Introit and all kisses are omitted but the usual bows will be made. If lighted Candles are to be held by the Clergy and those in Choir during the Gospel and from the *Sanctus* to the Communion of the Celebrant and people inclusively, the Master of Ceremonies will see that the candles are placed in readiness before the Service and appoint two or more clerks to distribute them at the conclusion of the Epistle: they should be presented, with the usual bows before and after, to all those who are in the Chancel, vested in Surplice, beginning with the senior in dignity, on either side. When all are distributed, the clerks proceed to light them and at the end of the Gospel will extinguish them: they will be lighted again during the Preface, before the *Sanctus*, and extinguished when the Celebrant takes the first Ablution.

ACOLYTES. The Acolytes do not make the Sign of the Cross at the Introit and during the Collects will kneel, standing again at the Epistle. At the Gospel, they assist as usual but do not carry their Candlesticks. At the Offertory, when the Sub-deacon carries the Chalice to the Altar, the two Acolytes follow him, the first, to present the Cruets as at other times and the second, to receive the Chalice Veil, which he carries to the Credence. After the incensing of the Celebrant, the first Acolyte presents the towel to the Deacon and the second, presents the Water Cruet and dish to the Sub-deacon, receiving them again after the washing of the Celebrant’s hands. All kisses are omitted but the bows before and after presenting anything, are made as usual. The Acolytes will kneel after the *Sanctus* and remain kneeling till the \[page 86\] *Agnus Dei* exclusively. They do not strike their breasts at the *Agnus Dei*. If they are holding torches, they will kneel before the *Sanctus* and remain kneeling till the Celebrant takes the first Ablution.

THURIFER. The Thurifer has no duty before the Offertory. At the Offertory, he brings in the Thurible and acts as usual, but after the incensing of the Celebrant, he receives the Thurible from the Deacon and at once carries it to the Sacristy, All kisses are omitted but the accustomed bows are made as usual. He enters the Sanctuary with the Torchbearers during the Preface, as at other times, and when the Master of the Ceremonies has put incense into the Thurible, presents it to the Sub-deacon and receives it from him again, after he has incensed the Blessed Sacrament. He then retires alone to the Sacristy and having deposited the Thurible in its place, returns to the Sanctuary and at the proper time, if the Acolytes be engaged holding torches, presents the Cruets for the Ablutions and carries the Chalice Veil to the Gospel side of the Altar.

If present in the Sanctuary in the earlier part of the Service, he does not make the Sign of the Cross at the Introit; he kneels with the Acolytes at the Collects, and remains standing near the Credence during the Gospel.

## SPECIAL DUTIES OF THE MINISTERS WHERE FOLDED CHASUBLES ARE WORN.

In Cathedrals and the principal Churches where it is customary for the Deacon and Sub-deacon to wear folded Chasubles during Advent and Lent, the following rules should be observed:

DEACON. While the Celebrant is reading the Gospel, the Deacon will descend to the pavement and, there assisted by the second Acolyte, will remove the folded Chasuble and put on the large Stole, which he wears over the ordinary one and retains until he has transferred the Missal to the Epistle side after the last Ablution, when he removes the large Stole and resumes the folded Chasuble.

SUB-DEACON. During the last Collect, the Sub-deacon, assisted by the second Acolyte, will remove his folded Chasuble, and resume it again when he has sung the Epistle, after he has received the Celebrant’s benediction.

ACOLYTES. When the Celebrant is singing the last Collect, the second Acolyte will assist the Sub-deacon to remove the folded Chasuble and will then deposit it in a convenient place; after the Epistle, he assists him to resume it. During the time the Celebrant is reading the Gospel, the same Acolyte will aid the Deacon in a similar way and the first Acolyte will present him with the large Stole. After the last Ablution, the first Acolyte will receive the large Stole from the Deacon and the second Acolyte will assist him to resume the folded Chasuble.

MASTER OF CEREMONIES. If the Acolytes be otherwise occupied, the Master of Ceremonies should assist the Deacon and Sub-deacon to take off and resume their folded Chasubles.

## THE ORDER OF THE CEREMONIES AT A CHORAL CELEBRATION OF THE HOLY EUCHARIST WITHOUT DEACON AND SUB-DEACON, AND WITHOUT INCENSE.

### I. Of the General Preparations.

The Priest who is to celebrate, will do so in the same manner as at a Low Celebration (*vide* pp. 31-44) but will sing the Collects, Preface, intonations of Creed and *Gloria*, &c., as at a High Celebration; he will be served by two Acolytes who will observe all the ceremonies prescribed for the Server at a Low Celebration (*vide* pp. 44-47), and, in addition, those which are here described.

On a table in the Sacristy will be prepared the Vestments for the Celebrant, and at the usual place the Torches for the Elevation. On the Altar, at the Epistle side, the Missal will be placed open at the Service of the day, with the markers properly arranged, and in the centre, the first Acolyte, if he have power or permission to touch the Sacred Vessels, will arrange the Chalice on the extended Corporal, and if required, the Ciborium will be placed behind it. The Chalice will be covered with its Veil, the Burse being against the gradine on the Gospel side, as usual (*vide* p. 32).

On the Credence, the Cruets with wine and water, the basin and finger-towel, the Book of Epistles, if the first Acolyte be a Cleric, and the Alms Dish. The Breads should be placed in readiness, as at a High Celebration (*vide* p. 51). The second Acolyte will light the candles at the Altar and the first Acolyte will assist the Priest to vest.

### II. Of the Entrance and Commencement of the Service.

When all is in readiness, the Acolytes place themselves on either side of the Celebrant, the first Acolyte being at his right hand, and with him make a reverence to the Cross of the Sacristy. They then unite and with joined hands, precede the Celebrant to the Altar. Arrived at the steps of the Altar, the Celebrant uncovers and hands his Biretta to the first Acolyte, who unites with the second Acolyte in making the proper reverence to the Altar, and then carries the Biretta to the Sedilia. He returns to the Celebrant and kneels at his right, but a little behind, and the second Acolyte kneels in like manner at the Celebrant’s left. They unite in making the responses to the preparatory prayers and when the Celebrant is about to ascend to the Altar, they rise and, if necessary, raise the Celebrant’s Vestments slightly in front while he ascends the steps. They then kneel upon the lowest step, the first Acolyte facing the Epistle corner, and the second the Gospel corner of the Altar. They make with the Celebrant, the Sign of the Cross at the Introit and say all the responses as usual.

They remain kneeling until the conclusion of the Epistle, unless the first Acolyte be a Cleric, when he may sing the Epistle, in which case both Acolytes should rise at the beginning of the last Collect and make the proper reverence in the centre together. The second proceeds to the Celebrant’s right to assist at the Book, if necessary, and the first goes to the Credence, takes the Book of Epistles, returns to his usual place behind the Celebrant and stands upon the pavement until the concluding words of the Collect, when he passes to the centre, makes the proper reverence, and returns to his former place, where \[page 88\] he sings the Epistle to its proper tone. At its conclusion, he again goes to the centre to make the proper reverence to the Altar and then carries the Book of Epistles to the Credence. He returns and kneels in his usual place; the second Acolyte meanwhile or when the Celebrant has read the Gradual, &c., conveys the Missal (by the longest way) to the Gospel side of the Altar, after which he kneels in his usual place, unless the Celebrant at once begins the Gospel. If there be a long Tract or Sequence, the Celebrant may sit down while it is sung by the Choir, as at a High Celebration (*vide* Note to No. 8. p. 60). The Acolytes rise, unite in the centre, make the proper reverence to the Altar and precede the Celebrant to his seat. The first stations himself on the right and the second at the left, they raise the Celebrant’s Chasuble so that he may not sit upon it and the first Acolyte then presents the Biretta. During the singing, while the Celebrant remains seated, the Acolytes stand on either side of him, partly facing each other, taking care to turn their backs neither to the Altar nor to the Celebrant. When it is time to return to the Altar, the first Acolyte receives the Biretta and places it upon the seat. Both Acolytes precede the Celebrant to the Altar, going by the longest way; arrived at the centre, they unite with him in making the proper reverence to the Altar and then kneel in their usual places.

When the Celebrant is about to announce the Gospel, both Acolytes rise and at its conclusion, having made the usual response, they kneel again and so remain until the Celebrant has recited the Creed and is about to sit down. When the Celebrant recites the Creed, the Acolytes make the usual inclinations and a profound bow at *And was Incarnate*, *&c*., and the Sign of the Cross at the end, as usual. If the Celebrant should sit while the Choir sing the Creed, the Acolytes will act as already directed for the Sequence, but at the words *came down from Heaven*, the first Acolyte by a bow, directs the Celebrant to take off his Biretta and then kneels with the second Acolyte turned towards the Altar—the Celebrant also kneels on Christmas Day, and on the Feast of the Annunciation— after the words *and was made Man*, they rise, and the first directs the Celebrant to put on his Biretta. The same directions are to be given by the first Acolyte before and after the words *together is worshipped*; at the end of the Creed, unless there is to be a Sermon, he receives the Biretta, puts it on the seat and with the second, accompanies the Celebrant to the Altar. If there be a Sermon, the Acolytes may sit on stools placed on either side of the Celebrant, but not in the Sedilia, but if the Celebrant be the Preacher and should give the Sermon from the Pulpit, the Acolytes will first assist him to remove the Chasuble and Maniple, which they place upon the Sedilia and then accompany him to the Pulpit. They may sit near the Pulpit and at the conclusion of the Sermon, re-conduct the, Celebrant to the Sedilia, aid him to resume the Chasuble and Maniple and then precede him to the Altar.

### III. From the Offertory to the Communion of the People.

After the Creed or after the Celebrant has returned to the Altar and has said *The Lord be with you* and *Let us pray*, as usual, the Acolytes unite and make the proper reverence in the centre, the first proceeds to the Credence, the second goes to the right of the Celebrant, receives the Chalice Veil, folds it in three so that only the exterior shall appear, and places it on the Altar, just beyond the Corporal on the Epistle side. The first Acolyte having approached the Epistle corner of the Altar, carrying both the Cruets, gives that containing the water to the second Acolyte who then places himself at his left. They each hold their Cruet in the right hand and stand upon the highest step below the predella facing the Celebrant. They salute the Celebrant together, as he approaches, and after presenting the wine and water in the accustomed manner, salute the Celebrant again and then return to the Credence, on which the first Acolyte places the Wine Cruet. They go again to the Altar, the first carrying the finger-towel and the second, the Water Cruet and the dish; they bow to the \[page 89\] Celebrant before and after he washes his fingers, replace the Cruet, dish and towel on the Credence and then, after the proper reverence in the centre, return to their usual places and kneel there until the Consecration. The first Acolyte will ring the bell if used at the *Sanctus* (*vide* Note 8. p. 75). Torch-bearers should be provided as at a High Celebration (*vide* p. 77), but if there be no Torch-bearers, two candles may be placed in large Candlesticks, standing on the floor, at either side of the Altar; these should be lighted by the first Acolyte at the commencement of the Consecration Prayer. At the words *Who in the same night*, both Acolytes should rise, meet and make the proper reverence in the centre, and then kneel on the highest step, a little to the right and left of the Celebrant, the first taking care to bring the bell with him; they unite in raising the Celebrant’s Chasuble at each Elevation.

When the Celebrant is about to receive the Sacred Blood, the Acolytes rise (unless about to make their own Communions), make a genuflection where they are, upon both knees, then separate and kneel on either side of the Altar, parallel with the top step, facing sideways. The first Acolyte carries the bell with him and places it on the Credence.

### IV. From the Communion to the End of the Service.

When all have communicated, the Acolytes proceed to the centre, where they meet and genuflect upon the pavement on both knees and then go to their usual places where they kneel and the Service proceeds as at a Low Celebration (*vide* p. 46).

At the Ablutions, the first Acolyte ministers the wine and water; the second, in the meantime, remains in his place until the Celebrant has taken the second Ablution, he then rises, makes, where he is, the proper reverence, then ascends to the Altar, removes the Book by the longest way to the Epistle side, then descends to the pavement, makes the proper reverence and kneels in his usual place. The first Acolyte after the Ablutions, replaces the Cruets on the Credence, goes to the Altar for the Chalice Veil, then proceeds to the centre where he meets the second with the Missal, and joins with him in the proper reverence, ascends to the left of the Celebrant and presents the Burse and Veil at the proper time. He receives the Chalice when arranged, from the Celebrant and conveys it by the longest way to the Credence. If the first Acolyte be a Cleric, he may cleanse and arrange the Chalice as is done by the Sub-deacon at a High Celebration (*vide* p. 80).

If candles have been lighted for the Elevation, the first Acolyte will extinguish that which is on the side of the Epistle before taking the Cruets for the Ablutions and the second will extinguish that on the side of the Gospel, before he ascends to the Altar to remove the Book to the Epistle corner.

Both Acolytes stand in their usual places at the Last Gospel (if the Book be required for the Last Gospel, the second Acolyte will have removed it to the Gospel corner), make the usual Signs of the Cross and say *Glory be to Thee*, *O Lord*, the first then goes to the Sedilia for the Biretta, both genuflect with the Celebrant and at the conclusion, say *Thanks be to God*. The Celebrant having descended to the pavement, the Acolytes place themselves on either side of him and unite in the proper reverence to the Altar; the first presents the Celebrant’s Biretta and they then precede him to the Sacristy, as on entering.

Arrived at the Sacristy, they salute the Cross and the Celebrant, and assist him to unvest, or the first does so while the second extinguishes the candles, &c.

\[page 90\]

## THE ORDER OF THE CEREMONIES AT A CHORAL CELEBRATION OF THE HOLY EUCHARIST WITHOUT DEACON AND SUB-DEACON, BUT WITH INCENSE.

Strictly, according to all liturgical rules, Incense may not be used at the Holy Eucharist unless the Celebrant be attended by Deacon and Sub-deacon and except for deficiency of Clergy, it is most undesirable that on Sundays and Holy days the Divine Mysteries should be in any way shorn of their due ceremonial.

A High Celebration, with Deacon and Sub-deacon, is the most ancient form of celebrating the Holy Eucharist and the one most in accord with the mind of the Church but it must happen in many places that except on rare occasions, owing to deficiency of Clergy, a High Celebration is an impossibility; the rule as to Incense has, therefore, been relaxed in special cases and its use permitted, at least, on high Festivals at a Choral Celebration, without Sacred Ministers, in places where otherwise it could never be used with propriety. Owing to this toleration it seems desirable to give the rules, prescribed by the best authors, for a Service under such conditions.

### I. Of the General Preparations.

The Ministers required are the Celebrant, the Master of Ceremonies, the Acolytes and the Thurifer. The preparations at the Altar and at the Credence are the same as at a Choral Celebration without incense (*vide* p. 87) except that the Chalice, &c., will be prepared by the Master of Ceremonies, if he have power or permission to touch the Sacred Vessels, and he will see that everything is in readiness for the Service. The Thurible, Incense-boat and Acolytes’ Candlesticks will be required as at a High Celebration.

### II. Of the Entrance into the Sanctuary.

When all is in readiness, the Master of Ceremonies gives the signal for the entrance to the Church, the Acolytes take their Candlesticks, make the usual reverences, and precede the Choir and Clergy into the Church, unless they have already entered it, in which case the Acolytes walk before the Master of Ceremonies who immediately precedes the Celebrant. The Thurifer will follow the directions given for his entrance at a High Celebration (*vide* Nos. 2-3, p. 53), according to the occasion.

### III. The Celebrant

will observe all the ceremonies prescribed for a Choral Celebration without incense, with the addition of the incensings of the Altar, &c., as at a High Celebration (*vide* Nos. 4, 5, 6, 15, 16, 17, pp. 56-72).

Before the Gospel, he blesses the incense as usual, while the Choir sing the concluding part of the Gradual or Tract; he says the prayer *Cleanse my heart*, *&c*., in the centre and then goes to the Gospel corner to read the Gospel. He says *The Lord be with you* and announces the Gospel as at other times and then receives the Thurible from the Master of Ceremonies. He incenses the Book with three double swings, the first towards the middle, the second towards the right (his left) and the third towards the left of the Book, making before and after the \[page 91\] incensing a profound inclination towards the Book. He returns the Thurible to the Master of Ceremonies and sings the Gospel in the accustomed manner.

At the conclusion, he kisses the Book and is then incensed by the Master of Ceremonies.

### IV. The Master of Ceremonies

on arriving at the steps of the Altar, will receive the Celebrant’s Biretta, as at a High Celebration, will place it on the Sedilia and will then kneel at the Celebrant’s left and respond in the usual way to the preparatory prayers, making the Signs of the Cross and customary inclinations,

When the Celebrant ascends to the Altar, he rises, makes the proper reverence in the centre and then goes to the predella, at the Epistle side. He receives the Incense-boat from the Thurifer, presents first the spoon and then the Thurible to the Celebrant and assists at the incensing of the Altar, observing all the directions prescribed for the Deacon at a High Celebration (*vide* Nos. 4-5, p. 56). The incensing of the Altar completed, he receives the Thurible and incenses the Celebrant (*vide* No. 6, p. 58); having returned the Thurible to the Thurifer, he goes to the highest step at the side of the Altar, near the Book and indicates to the Celebrant with his hand, the beginning of the Introit, &c,, as at a High Celebration. He remains in the same place until the Celebrant has read the Gradual, Tract, &c., unless he be a Cleric and may sing the Epistle himself, in this case he will follow the directions given for the first Acolyte, page 87, and after replacing the Book on the Credence, will return to the side of the Celebrant. If there be a long Tract or Sequence and the Celebrant sit while it is sung by the Choir, the Master of Ceremonies will precede him to the Sedilia, arrange the Chasuble, and present the Biretta. He stands at the Celebrant’s left, turned towards him, until it is time to return to the Altar, when he bows to the Celebrant, receives the Biretta, deposits it on the seat and precedes the Celebrant, going by the longest way. He makes the proper reverence in the centre and ascends to the Altar and assists at the blessing of the incense, as at the Introit. He then goes to the Epistle corner, takes the Missal and descends to the pavement; he makes the proper reverence in the centre with the Acolytes and then places the Missal on the Altar at the Gospel corner. He remains on the highest step at the Celebrant’s left to turn the leaves of the Book, if necessary, and after the announcement of the Gospel, he receives the Thurible from the Thurifer, presents it to the Celebrant, and receives it again after the incensing of the Book. He bows profoundly towards the Book both before and after the incensing.

At the end of the Gospel he moves the Book up to the Corporal, and then descends to the lowest step at the side of the Gospel, receives the Thurible, incenses the Celebrant, returns the Thurible to the Thurifer and then goes to the Epistle side where he stands upon the pavement, while the Celebrant recites the Creed. He must take care to make the proper reverence to the Altar when passing the centre.

During the Creed he genuflects with the Celebrant, makes the proper inclinations and the Sign of the Cross as usual. If the Celebrant should sit while the Choir sing the Creed, he will precede him to the Sedilia, arrange the Chasuble, present the Biretta, and stand at his left as above directed at the Sequence. He will intimate to the Celebrant by a bow as at a High Celebration, (*vide* No. 12, p. 65), when he has to uncover and when it is time to return to the Altar and will himself kneel turned towards the Altar, at the singing of *And was Incarnate*, *&c*.

If there be a Sermon, he will act as at a High Celebration (*vide* p. 67).

The Creed or the Sermon, if there be one, being ended, he accompanies the Celebrant to the Altar and then proceeds to the Epistle side, near the Credence, where he remains until the Celebrant has offered the Chalice, he then ascends to the predella with the Thurifer and assists at the blessing of incense and the \[page 92\] incensation of the Altar, and then incenses the Celebrant, as at the Introit. He returns the Thurible to the Thurifer and then ascends to the Celebrant’s left and assists at the Book as usual. When the Thurifer returns to the Sanctuary after incensing the Choir, he incenses the Master of Ceremonies who turns towards him and salutes him before and after being incensed.

The Master of Ceremonies remains at the left of the Celebrant, near the Missal, until the Prayer of Consecration. He kneels below the predella during the Confession and Absolution and also at the Prayer of Humble Access. He says the Confession and makes the Sign of the Cross as usual at the Absolution. At the beginning of the Prayer of Consecration, he descends to the pavement, makes the proper reverence in the centre and proceeds to the Epistle side. He puts incense into the Thurible, which is presented to him by the Thurifer, and then kneels. At the Elevation, if the Acolytes are holding torches, he will ring the bell and raise the Celebrant’s Chasuble. After the second Elevation, he rises and returns to the Celebrant’s left, where he makes the genuflection on arrival and not in the centre. He continues to turn the leaves of the Book until the Celebrant commences to say *Lord*, *I am not worthy*, *&c*., he then makes a genuflection and passes to the Epistle side (without again genuflecting in the centre); he kneels there, turned towards the Gospel side, until after the Communion of the people. When all have communicated, he rises and returns to the Celebrant’s left, genuflecting on arrival as before.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) He kneels at the Benediction below the predella, then rises, genuflects and passes to his usual place at the Epistle side. After the last Ablution, when the Book has been carried to the Epistle side, he goes to the Celebrant’s right and points out the Communion and the prayers that follow. After the last prayer, he closes the Book unless there be a proper Gospel, in which case he conveys the Missal to the Gospel side. During the Last Gospel he assists at the left of the Celebrant, makes the Signs of the Cross, inclinations, &c., as usual and at the end closes the Book, if it has been used, descends to the pavement, makes the usual reverence in the centre and fetches the Celebrant’s Biretta from the Sedilia. When the Celebrant has descended the steps, he presents the Biretta, makes the proper reverence to the Altar, turns and precedes the Celebrant to the Sacristy. Arrived at the Sacristy he carries out the directions in No. 25, page 83.

### V. The Acolytes

carry out all the directions prescribed for them at a High Celebration (pp. 53-83) except in the following respects. The first assists the Celebrant to vest, while the second lights the candles.

When the Celebrant incenses the Cross, the first Acolyte (without first going to the centre) goes to the Book and removes it with its desk from the Altar; he stands below the steps at the Epistle side until the Celebrant has incensed that part of the Altar, then replaces the Book on the Altar and goes at once to his usual place at the Credence.

If the Celebrant sit at the Sequence or Creed, they may do the same but will kneel at *And was Incarnate*, *&c*., as usual.

The first Acolyte (or the Master of Ceremonies) if he be in Holy Orders may chant the Epistle, following the directions given on page 87.

Before the Gospel, they take their Candlesticks and proceed to the centre and make there the proper reverence with the Thurifer as usual. If the space will permit, the Acolytes do not follow the Thurifer but walk on either side, the first being at his right and the second at his left; they pass below the lowest step to the Gospel corner of the Altar and there stand in a line facing the Celebrant during the singing of the Gospel. After the Gospel, they return in the same \[page 93\] order to the centre, make the proper reverence and then go to the Credence where they deposit their Candlesticks and stand as usual.

When the Celebrant has said the Offertory, the second Acolyte goes to the right of the Celebrant, makes there the proper reverence, and receives the Chalice Veil, folds and places it on the Altar at the Epistle side. During this time the first Acolyte takes the Cruets from the Credence and carries them to the Altar, he gives the Water Cruet to the second Acolyte who places himself at his left, they each hold their Cruets in the right hand. They salute the Celebrant as he approaches and present the Cruets in the usual manner. When the second Acolyte has again received the Water Cruet, they once more salute the Celebrant and retire to the Credence. When the Celebrant has incensed the Cross, the first Acolyte passes to the Gospel side, making the proper reverence as he passes the centre, and removes the Missal as at the Introit. He stands below the steps at the Gospel side, until the Celebrant has incensed that part of the Altar and then replaces the Missal as before. He descends to the pavement, makes the proper reverence in the centre and returns to the Credence. When the Master of Ceremonies incenses the Celebrant, the Acolytes take the Water Cruet, &c., and for the rest of the Service act as at a High Celebration (*vide* Nos. 17-25, pp. 73-83) except, i. at the commencement of the Prayer of Consecration, they will descend to the pavement, make the proper reverence in the centre and then kneel on the highest step behind the Celebrant to raise his Chasuble at the Elevations: after the second Elevation, they rise, descend to the lowest step, make there the genuflection and retire to the Credence; ii. at the Ablutions, the first Acolyte will minister the Cruets and the second move the Book as at a Choral Celebration without incense (*vide* p. 89). If there be no Torch-bearers, candles may be lighted for the Elevation as at a Choral Celebration without incense or the Acolytes may themselves act as Torch-bearers, in which case the Master of Ceremonies will ring the bell and raise the Celebrant’s Chasuble.

### VI. The Torch-bearers

will act precisely as at a High Celebration (*vide* p. 77).

### VII. The Thurifer

will carry out all the directions prescribed for a High Celebration (*vide* pp. 53-81), with the following exceptions. After the blessing of the incense at the Introit, he presents the Thurible to the Master of Ceremonies and then passes to the Celebrant’s left; during the incensing of the Altar, he raises the Chasuble with his right hand, the left being placed upon his breast, and makes with the Celebrant the proper reverence when they pass the centre of the Altar. At the conclusion of the incensing, he descends the steps at the Epistle corner by the shortest way and stands at the left of the Master of the Ceremonies while he incenses the Celebrant, making with him an inclination before and after the incensing.

After the blessing of the incense before the Gospel, he descends to the pavement, makes the proper reverence in the centre at the same time as the Master of Ceremonies and Acolytes and if the space permit, walks between the Acolytes, below the steps, to the Gospel corner of the Altar where they stand in a line facing the Celebrant during the singing of the Gospel.

At the conclusion of the Gospel, he gives the Thurible to the Master of Ceremonies and receives it again when he has incensed the Celebrant; he then returns with the Acolytes to the centre, makes the proper reverence and retires to the Sacristy, with the Thurible as usual.

After the blessing of the incense, at the Offertory, he acts as at the Introit and when the Celebrant has been incensed, receives the Thurible from the Master of Ceremonies. He proceeds to the centre, makes the proper reverence and \[page 94\] then goes to incense the Clergy and Choir in the same manner as is done by the Deacon at a High Celebration (*vide* No. 170, p. 72). He returns to the Sanctuary, makes the proper reverence in the centre, incenses the Master of Ceremonies with a single swing, again makes the proper reverence and then turns by his right and advances towards the Credence and incenses the Acolytes, with one swing for each. He proceeds to the entrance of the Chancel and incenses the people with three swings (*vide* No. 17, p. 73).

If the Acolytes be engaged in holding Torches, he will minister the Cruets at the Ablutions and will also carry the Chalice Veil to the Gospel side and move the Book to the Epistle side of the Altar, if the Acolytes have not returned to the Credence in time to perform these duties.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR HOLY WEEK.

(*Vide* pp. 11-12.)

On Palm Sunday, during the Epistle when the Celebrant, or the Sub-deacon, arrives at the words "at the Name of JESUS" all kneel until the words "under the earth" inclusively.

Incense is blessed and the Book is incensed, as usual, before the Gospel (except on Good Friday), but the *Dominus vobiscum* and the *Gloria Tibi* are omitted and the Celebrant, or the Deacon, will not make the Signs of the Cross upon the Book or upon himself, except on Holy Saturday.

On Palm Sunday, at the High Celebration, the Celebrant and all the others, except the Deacon, Sub-deacon, Master of Ceremonies and the Thurifer, will hold their Palms in their hands while the Gospel is being sung. At the conclusion of the Service, all carry their Palms with them into the Sacristy, except the Sacred Ministers, the Master of Ceremonies and the Acolytes.

When the words " yielded up the Ghost" occur in the Gospels during Holy Week, all kneel, except the Sub-deacon and Acolytes, in the places where they are, but the Celebrant and Master of Ceremonies do so turning towards the Altar. (At a High Celebration, the Celebrant does not genuflect at these words, when he reads the Gospel secretly.)

During Holy Week, the Acolytes assist at the Gospel without their Candlesticks but on Palm Sunday, may carry Palms instead.

On Good Friday, no response is made after either the Epistle or Gospel. The Sub-deacon does not present himself for the Officiant’s blessing after having sung the Epistle. The prayer *Cleanse my heart*, *&c*., is said before the Gospel as usual, but the benediction is omitted, also *Through the words of the Gospel*, *&c*., at the conclusion and the Officiant does not kiss the Book.

On Holy Saturday, the Psalm *Judica me* and the *Gloria Patri* are resumed, and also the *Dominus vobiscum*, *Gloria Tibi* and Signs of the Cross before the Gospel.

## RULES FOR SACRISTANS.

1\. At least, three or four times each year, when the weather is dry, the Altars should be stripped early in the morning and left so until the evening, that everything may have the advantage of fresh air. At the same time everything connected with the Altar, the predella and spaces at the sides or beneath, should be well cleaned. Hangings on the walls of the Sanctuary should be taken down and well shaken or dusted.

2\. The predella of the Altar should be swept daily and the gradines, Cross and Candlesticks dusted at least once a week.

3\. The whole of the Sanctuary and Choir should be swept at least weekly and the parts not carpeted, washed over at frequent intervals.

4\. Candlesticks, Crosses and other articles of metal should not be handled with the bare hands but with a cloth. When not required in use they should be carefully cleaned and put away in linen or calico bags.

\[page 95\]

5\. Every six months the Chalices, Patens and Ciboriums should be washed in water, with soap and brush, then in two other waters. This should be done by one in Holy Orders, who will pour the water into the Piscina.

6\. The Cruets and Lavabo Dish, as well as being rinsed out after use, should be thoroughly washed every month.

7\. The "fair linen Cloth" for the Altars should be changed once a month, and the under Cloths four times a year.

8\. Corporals, if used daily, should be changed at least every three weeks, and the Priest should be provided with a clean Purificator for each Celebration.

9\. When the Corporals and Purificators are removed, they should be placed in a box kept especially for that purpose. Before being sent to be washed by lay persons, they should be washed by one in Holy Orders, first in soap and water, and then in two other waters which should be poured into the Piscina.

10\. If there be any wax droppings on the "fair linen Cloth" or on the Corporals or Purificators, they may be removed by carefully scraping them with a knife, and then soaking the part in spirits of wine. Wine stains may be removed by holding the part in boiling milk.

11\. Albs, Girdles, Amices and Towels, should be changed as frequently as may be necessary, according to the number of Clergy. No general rule can be given as to the Surplices for the Clergy, Acolytes and Choir, as so much depends on the number of Services and the care taken in their use, but they should be washed as often as requisite and for all the great Festivals a complete change of all the linen vestments should be provided.

12\. Each day, after the last Celebration of the Holy Eucharist, the "fair linen Cloth" should be lightly brushed and then covered; the dust should be well shaken out of the cover itself every week.

13\. The Sacred Vestments, after being in use, should be carefully folded and put away in their proper places. The best method of keeping them is in presses fitted with shallow drawers, made just deep enough to hold one set of Vestments. The drawers should be lined, if possible, with cedar, to keep out insects and some few, to be reserved for the more costly Vestments, should be again lined with baize or cloth dyed in saffron, which preserves gold and embroidery work. To prevent creases being left in the more valuable Vestments, rolls of wool padding should be placed in the folds. Vestments of cloth of gold or silver should be wrapped in unbleached calico, dipped in a decoction of saffron. Where presses are not available, an excellent method of keeping the Vestments is to hang them upon wooden yokes in a cupboard. This avoids any folding but calico bags or covers will be necessary to keep out the dust.

14\. Every article should have its own appointed place, and should be kept there when not required for use.

15\. Wax Candles improve by keeping a few months before being used. They should be kept in a drawer by themselves and the ends or refuse wax should be placed in a separate receptacle. The Sacristan must be careful that the Altar Candlesticks and also those of the Acolytes are duly furnished with Candles, that the wicks are ready for lighting and that there are no wax excrescences at the top, which will cause the Candles to gutter and waste. If the Candles be soiled by dirty fingers, they may be cleaned with a cloth damped in spirits of wine or turpentine. In lighting Candles, the taper should be held to the side of the wick, not over the top. The wicks of new Candles may be slightly touched before being put up with a minute drop of Venice Turpentine, to ensure their lighting readily.

16\. The glasses of the Sanctuary lamps should be washed in hot water every fortnight.

17\. Plated or silver articles can be cleansed by being rubbed with a linen cloth and occasionally washed in soap and water, and then polished with whitening or rouge.

\[page 96\]

18\. Lacquered brass-work merely requires dusting carefully with a soft cloth, or in a damp atmosphere to be wiped dry. Occasionally a little sweet oil, lightly rubbed on, may be used.

19\. Unlacquered brass-work should be cleaned with polishing paste and then well rubbed with wash-leather. If very much tarnished, a drop or two of oil of vitriol in the paste will remove the discolouration.

20\. Burnt incense may be removed from plated or silver Thuribles with sweet oil.

21\. Gilt wood or stone work should only be dusted with a soft brush or cloth. Encaustic tiles should be cleaned with milk and rubbed with a dry coarse flannel. Frescos, mural paintings, &c., should be very carefully dusted with an extremely soft feather brush.

22\. In the absence of the Clergy, the Sacristan should see that strict silence is preserved in the Sacristies, also that the Acolytes or Servers put on their Cassocks and Surplices in an orderly and becoming manner and after the Service, replace them in their proper places.

23\. No lay person is to be allowed to remain in the inner Sacristy, except the Master of Ceremonies, the Assistants in Copes, the Acolytes, Thurifer and Servers.

24\. Several pairs of clean shoes or slippers should always be kept in readiness in the Sacristy, for the use of the Clergy, also a Clothes brush.

## OF THE ASPERGES, OR SPRINKLING WITH HOLY WATER.

### I. Of the Order of the Ceremonial.

The aspersion of holy-water should take place on all Sundays of the year, before the principal Eucharist, unless the Bishop be the Celebrant, but in no case should the aspersion be made more than once in the same Church on the same day.

The Priest who is to celebrate should make the aspersion, and if the water have to be blessed immediately before the Service it should be done in the Sacristy. For the blessing of the water, the Priest may wear a Surplice and Violet Stole, or, if he is to be the Celebrant, he may first vest in Amice, Alb, Girdle and crossed Stole of the colour of the day. In the latter case, if there be Sacred Ministers they should be already vested with the exception of their Maniples, which will be placed on the Sedilia in the Sanctuary, with the Chasuble and Maniple of the Celebrant. (If folded Chasubles are to be used, the Deacon and Sub-deacon do not put them on until they have vested the Celebrant in the Cope for the aspersion.) The Sacred Ministers, if there be any, should assist at the blessing of the water; before a *Missa Cantata* this duty will be performed by the Acolytes. The Thurifer will attend to carry the holy-water vessel and the sprinkler. All the preparations for the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist which is to follow, should be made as usual, *vide* pp. 51, 87 or 90, the only addition required in the Sacristy, being the vessel containing the holy-water and the sprinkler, unless the water has first to be blessed, in which case a vessel with salt and the Book containing the form of benediction will be also needed.

After the blessing of the water or when all is in readiness, the Deacon and Sub-deacon (or when there are no Sacred Ministers, the Acolytes) will vest the Celebrant in a Cope of the colour of the day and will then put on their folded Chasubles, if they are to be worn. At a *Missa Cantata* without Sacred Ministers, a Cope for the Celebrant is not an essential, but, if possible, one should be provided, at least, on the greater Sundays of the year.

\[page 97\]

The Candles on the Altar and those of the Acolytes will be lighted before the aspersion is made. At the proper time the entrance into the Sanctuary will be as usual (*vide* pp. 52-55, 87, or 90), the Thurifer carrying the holy-water vessel in his right hand, the left extended upon his breast, preceding the Acolytes, and the Deacon and Sub-deacon walking on either side of the Celebrant, and raising the borders of the Cope. At a *Missa Cantata* the Acolytes precede the Celebrant as usual, but if there be no Thurifer, the first Acolyte will carry the holy-water vessel in his left hand, so as to be able to present or receive the Celebrant’s Biretta in his right hand, and the second Acolyte walks with his hands joined before his breast, unless he has to carry a Book or card containing the Service.

Arrived at the Altar, the Celebrant and the Sacred Ministers uncover and make the proper reverence to the Altar, as usual, and then kneel on the lowest step.

The Master of Ceremonies carries the Birettas to the Sedilia and the Acolytes, if carrying Candlesticks, convey them to the Credence and kneel there as usual.

The Clergy and others in choir remain standing and, if it be customary, turned towards the Altar.

So soon as the Master of Ceremonies has received the Birettas, the Thurifer goes to the right of the Deacon, kneels on the floor; changes the holy-water vessel from his right to his left hand; and taking the sprinkler, presents it to the Deacon. The Deacon taking the sprinkler, presents it to the Celebrant, kissing first it and then the hand of the Celebrant. The Celebrant, intoning *Thou shalt purge me*, or *I saw water*, according to the season, thrice asperses the Altar, first towards the middle, afterwards towards the Gospel side, and lastly towards the Epistle side. Then, still kneeling, he asperses himself, making a little Sign of the Cross upon his forehead, with the end of the sprinkler. He rises and asperses first the Deacon and then the Sub-deacon, who, during this time remain kneeling on the step. They afterward stand, and the Deacon receiving the sprinkler with the usual kisses, consigns it to the Thurifer. Having made the proper reverence to the Altar, the Celebrant and his Ministers proceed to asperse the Clergy and Choir. The Thurifer, carrying the holy-water, and the Master of Ceremonies precede the Celebrant, who is attended on either side by his Ministers to hold back the borders of the Cope. In aspersing the Clergy and the Choir in the Stalls, the Celebrant first receives the sprinkler from the Deacon as before, and then follows the rules laid down for the incensings by the Deacon (*vide* No. 17, p. 72) but after aspersing one side, he returns the sprinkler to the Deacon, makes the proper reverence to the Altar, then again receives the sprinkler and asperses those on the other side. He returns the sprinkler to the Deacon, makes the proper reverence to the Altar and proceeds to the entrance to the Chancel, where he again receives the sprinkler and asperses the people with three aspersions: (i.) to the middle, (ii.) to the Epistle side, (iii.) to the Gospel side; or the Celebrant may go in procession round the Church and asperse the people as he does so. Returning to the Sanctuary, he makes the proper reverence to the Altar and then asperses the Master of Ceremonies, the Acolytes and the Thurifer.

During the aspersions, the Thurifer will keep at the right of the Deacon, with the holy-water vessel in his left hand, so as to leave the right in readiness to receive or present the sprinkler; after being himself aspersed, he may retire at once to the Sacristy, put aside the holy-water vessel and sprinkler and prepare the Thurible.

All who are aspersed, should salute the Celebrant when he comes to them, then stand with bowed heads and make the Sign of the Cross while being aspersed.

While making the aspersion, the Celebrant and his Ministers recite in a low voice the whole of the Psalm *Miserere*, but during Eastertide they need say only the first verse of the Psalm *Confitemini Domino*, with the *Gloria Patri*, unless they are able to recite the whole from memory.

\[page 98\]

The Choir take up the Antiphon, as soon as the Celebrant has intoned the opening words, and then proceed to sing the Psalm, repeating the whole of the Antiphon at the end.

When the Celebrant has returned to the Sanctuary and completed the aspersions, he remains at the lowest step between his Ministers, until the singing of the Antiphon by the Choir is finished. He then chants the Versicles and Prayer from the Book which is held before him by the Sacred Ministers.

At the conclusion of the Prayer, the Celebrant and his Ministers make the proper reverence to the Altar and retire to the Sedilia, where, standing with their faces towards the Altar, the Deacon and Sub-deacon divest the Celebrant of the Cope and vest him in Maniple and Chasuble and then put on their own Maniples. They return to the foot of the Altar and commence the preparatory prayers in the usual manner. It is to be noted that the Birettas should never be worn by the Celebrant and his Ministers between the foot of the Altar and the Sedilia.

At a *Missa Cantata*, the Acolytes take the place of the Sacred Ministers, they kneel on entering, on either side of the Celebrant, and the first Acolyte presents and receives the sprinkler with the usual kisses. The Acolytes, if there be no Clergy in the Stalls, are aspersed immediately after the Celebrant, whilst still kneeling, but if there be Clergy in the Stalls, the Acolytes are not aspersed until after the people, and in that case they stand as usual.

### II. Of the Manner of Blessing the Water.

V/. Our help is in the Name of the LORD.
R/. Who hath made Heaven and earth.

I ADJURE thee, O creature of salt, by the Living + GOD, by the True + GOD, by the Holy + GOD, by GOD Who commanded thee to be cast, by the Prophet Elisha, into the water to heal the barrenness thereof; that thou become salt exorcised for the health of believers; and be thou to all them that take of thee health of soul and body, and let all vain imaginations and wickedness, all deceits and wiles of the Devil and every unclean spirit fly and depart from the place where thou shalt be sprinkled, adjured by Him, Who is to come and will judge the quick and the dead and the world by fire. R/. Amen.

Let us pray.

ALMIGHTY and Everlasting god, we humbly beseech Thine infinite mercy, that it may please Thee, of Thy loving-kindness to bl+ess and to hal+low this creature of salt which Thou hast given for the use of men, let it be to all them that take of it health of mind and body, and let whatsoever shall be touched or sprinkled therewith be free from all uncleanness, and from all assaults of spiritual wickedness. Through JESUS CHRIST, Thy SON, our LORD, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee, in the Unity of the HOLY GHOST, ever One GOD, world without end.

Let us pray *is not said*.

I ADJURE thee, O creature of water, in the Name of GOD the FATHER  + Almighty, in the Name of JESUS + CHRIST, His SON, our LORD, and in the power of the HOLY + GHOST, that thou become water exorcised for putting to flight all the power of the Enemy, and do thou avail to cast out and send hence that same Enemy, with all his apostate angels, through the power of the Same our LORD JESUS CHRIST, Who is to come and will judge the quick and the dead and the world by fire. R/. Amen.

Let us pray.

O GOD, Who for the salvation of mankind hast ordained that water should be the matter of one of Thy greatest Sacraments: favourably regard us who call upon Thee, and pour the power of Thy bene+diction upon this element, prepared by much cleansing; that this Thy creature, meet for Thy mysteries, may receive the effect of Thy grace, and so may cast out devils, and

\[page 99\]

put sickness to flight, that whosoever in the habitations of Thy faithful shall be sprinkled therewith, may be made free from all uncleanness and delivered from all hurtfulness; there let no spirit of pestilence nor corrupt air abide: thence let all the wiles of the hidden Enemy depart; and if there be aught that layeth snares against the peace or safety of them that dwell therein, let it fly before the sprinkling of this water, and so let the place gain health by the invocation of Thy Holy Name, and be defended from all assaults. Through JESUS CHRIST, Thy SON, our LORD, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee, in the Unity of the HOLY GHOST, ever One GOD, world without end.

*Here let the Priest thrice cast salt into the water*, *in the form of a Cross*, *saying at the same time*:

BE this salt and water mixed together, in the Name of the FA+THER, and of the S+ON, and of the HOLY + GHOST. R/. Amen.

If the water be in several vessels, the Priest will cast salt in the same manner into each of them.

V/. The LORD be with you. R/. And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

O GOD, Who art the Author of unconquered might, the King of the Empire that cannot be overthrown, the ever-glorious Conqueror: Who dost keep under the power of the dominion that is against Thee: Who rulest the raging of the fierce Enemy; Who dost mightily fight against the wickedness of Thy foes; we entreat and beseech Thee, with fear and trembling, O LORD, graciously to behold this creature of salt and water, mercifully shine upon it, hallow it with the dew of Thy loving-kindness: that wheresoever it may be sprinkled, through the invocation of Thy Holy Name, all haunting of the unclean spirit may be driven away, far thence let the terror of the venomous serpent be cast, and wheresoever it shall be, there let the presence of the HOLY GHOST be vouchsafed to us who shall ask for Thy mercy. Through JESUS CHRIST, Thy SON, our LORD, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee, in the Unity of the same HOLY GHOST, ever One GOD, world without end. Ry. Amen.

\[page 100\]

## OF THE ABSOLUTION FOR THE DEAD AT REQUIEMS.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)

When the Absolution is given immediately after the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist, which is the usual custom, it should be made by the Celebrant and not by another Priest, but if the Bishop be present he may make the Absolution, although he may not have been the Celebrant at the Requiem Eucharist. The ceremonies to be observed depend upon whether the body of the departed person be present or not.

### I. When the Body is Present.

If the body be present, it should be placed on a Bier with the feet towards the Altar, unless the departed be a Bishop or Priest, in which case the feet will be turned towards the people, and the Bier will be placed in the centre of the Chancel.[\[4\]](#_ftn4) At the end of the Holy Eucharist, after the last Gospel, the Celebrant and the Sacred Ministers, having made the proper reverence on the predella, go direct to the Sedilia and take off their Maniples. The Celebrant, with the assistance of the Sacred Ministers, also removes the Chasuble, and puts on a black Cope,[\[5\]](#_ftn5) which should be there in readiness. If there be a Sermon or Funeral oration, it will now be given, and during its delivery the Celebrant and his Ministers will be seated as usual. At the end of the Sermon, or at once if there be no Sermon, the Clergy and Choir light their candles and the Sub-deacon, with head uncovered, proceeds to the Credence, and there receives the Processional Cross, the Acolytes take their Candlesticks, and accompany him to the centre, where they are joined by the Thurifer and the Clerk with the holy-water vessel. They stand on the pavement, facing the Altar and await the Celebrant and Deacon, who, at a signal from the Master of Ceremonies, also descend to the pavement, and turn towards the Altar, the Deacon being at the right of the Celebrant and the Master of Ceremonies, with the Book of the Service at his left. The Master of Ceremonies first hands the Birettas to the Deacon, who presents the Celebrant with his (the usual kisses are omitted), and then all make the proper reverence to the Altar. They turn round and move towards the Bier, the Celebrant and Deacon being covered. The Procession proceeds in the following order: i. The Thurifer and Clerk with holy water; ii. The Sub-deacon between the two Acolytes; iii. The Choir[\[6\]](#_ftn6) and Clergy carrying lighted candles; iv. The Master of Ceremonies; v. The Celebrant, with the Deacon at his left to raise the border of his Cope.

Arrived at the Bier, the Thurifer and Clerk with holy water pass to the Epistle side, and so place themselves at the foot of the body, with their faces towards it, that they may be a little behind the Celebrant and Deacon when they arrive. The Acolytes proceed with the Sub-deacon, by the right, to the head of the body and stand facing it, but taking care to leave sufficient space for the Celebrant and Deacon to pass round at the aspersing and incensing. The Clergy should stand on either side facing the Bier, at a like distance from it as the Sub-deacon. The Choir, if they do not remain in the Stalls, will stand behind the Clergy on either side, or as may be found most convenient. The Celebrant, with the Deacon at his left, will stand at the foot of the body, facing the Cross held by the Sub-deacon, but a little towards the Epistle side, and both \[page 101\] uncover on arriving at the Bier. The Celebrant then reads the Prayer, *Enter not into judgment*, from the Book held before him by the Deacon, and the Choir respond *Amen*. Then the Cantors intone the opening words of the R/. *Deliver me*, which is continued by the Choir; the Cantors sing the V/V/. *I am in fear*, *That day*, and *Rest eternal*, and the Clergy after the first two repeat the words of the response, *When the Heavens*, and *When Thou shalt come*, as indicated in the Service by an asterisk. The R/. *Deliver me* is repeated by the Cantors and Choir, and during this, the Deacon, having given the Book to the Master of Ceremonies, salutes the Celebrant, and passes to his right, where he is joined by the Master of Ceremonies and the Thurifer. The Deacon, having received the Incense-boat, presents the spoon to the Celebrant, saying, *Bless*, *reverend father*, the Master of Ceremonies raises the border of the Cope, and the Celebrant puts incense thrice into the Thurible, saying, *Be thou blessed by Him in Whose honour thou art to be burned*. *Amen*. He returns the spoon to the Deacon, and then makes the Sign of the Cross over the Thurible.[\[7\]](#_ftn7) After the blessing of the incense, the Deacon returns to the left of the Celebrant, and the Thurifer to the left of the Clerk with holy water.

The R/. *Deliver me* being finished, the Choir on one side sing, *Lord*, *have mercy*, then those on the other side respond, *Christ*, *have mercy*, after which all say together, *Lord*, *have mercy*. After this, the Celebrant says in a loud voice, *Our Father*, continuing the Prayer, with all the others, in an undertone. The Clerk with holy water presents the sprinkler to the Deacon, who, in turn, presents it to the Celebrant. The Celebrant then makes an inclination to the Cross held by the Sub-deacon, and at the same time, the Deacon makes a genuflection. Then, if the Bier be in the Chancel, they turn towards the Altar, and make the proper reverence thereto, but if the Bier be in the middle of the Church, or not in sight of the Altar, this may be omitted.

The Celebrant, accompanied by the Deacon holding back the border of the Cope on the right side, passes round the Bier, by the right, and sprinkles the body three times on each side; in going, the first time towards the feet, then towards the middle, and lastly towards the head, and in returning, the first time towards the head, then towards the middle and lastly towards the feet. In passing the Cross of the Sub-deacon, he will make an inclination, and the Deacon a genuflection. Returned to his place, the Celebrant gives the sprinkler to the Deacon, who returns it to the Clerk, then receives the Thurible from the Thurifer, and presents it to the Celebrant. The Celebrant with the Deacon, without saluting the Cross of the Sub-deacon, proceed to the centre, turn to the Altar, and make the proper reverence (if they are in the Chancel), and then the Celebrant incenses the body with three swings on either side, in the same manner as he made the aspersion. When he has returned to his place, he gives the Thurible to the Deacon, who restores it to the Thurifer. The Deacon then receives the Book from the Master of Ceremonies, and standing at the left of the Celebrant, holds it open before him. The Celebrant says, *And lead us not into temptation*, and the following Versicles and Prayer, after which the body is carried to the grave.

If the Celebrant and his assistants accompany the body to the grave, the following is the order of the Procession: i. The Members of Guilds or Societies with which the deceased may have been connected; ii. The Thurifer and, at his left, the Clerk with holy water; iii. The Sub-deacon carrying the Cross[\[8\]](#_ftn8) between the two Acolytes with their Candlesticks; iv. The Choir and Clergy, two and two; v. The Master of Ceremonies, carrying the Book; vi. The Celebrant with the Deacon at his left; vii. The body of the deceased with the Pall-bearers; viii. The relatives and friends. On reaching the grave, the Cross-bearer and Acolytes, stand at the head; the Celebrant, Deacon, Master of Ceremonies, Thurifer, and Clerk with holy water at the foot and the relatives and friends near by. The Clergy and Choir, if it be convenient, will stand on either side of \[page 102\] the grave between the Celebrant and the Cross. At the end of the Burial Office when the Celebrant makes the Sign of the Cross over the body, saying *Rest eternal*, *grant to him*, *O Lord*, the Master of Ceremonies will hold back the border of the Cope as the Deacon will be holding the Book. The Choir respond, *And let light perpetual shine upon him*, and the Celebrant then says, *May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed*, *through the Mercy of God*, *rest in peace*. R/. *Amen*.

If the Celebrant and his assistants do not accompany the body to the grave, they will return to the Altar after the Prayer, make the proper reverence and retire to the Sacristy.

If the Cemetery be distant, the Priest who accompanies the body may be vested only in Surplice and black Stole.

If on account of a Solemn Feast or through any other necessity, the Absolution is not preceded by the Holy Eucharist, the Officiant vested in Surplice, black Stole and Cope, will make the Absolution immediately after the Lesson in the Burial Office, but will not be assisted by Deacon and Sub-deacon. Under such circumstances or when the Holy Eucharist has been celebrated without Sacred Ministers, the Cross will be carried by the ordinary Cross-bearer, a Clerk will be appointed to carry the Book and the Master of Ceremonies will take the place of the Deacon, holding back the border of the Cope, presenting the sprinkler and Thurible and accompanying the Celebrant during the aspersing and incensing.

If the body be that of a Bishop or Priest, since the head is towards the Altar, the place of the Sub-deacon with the Cross will be between the Altar and the Bier, while the Celebrant’s place will be at the feet, facing the Altar, and the following is the order which should be observed. The Sub-deacon preceded by the Thurifer and the Clerk with holy water, and accompanied by the Acolytes, proceeds as before by the Gospel side, but instead of stopping opposite the Altar, all pass on by the Epistle side and return to the head of the body, between the Altar and the Bier. The Sub-deacon and Acolytes face the Bier but stand a little towards the Epistle side. The Thurifer and the Clerk with holy water do not stop with the others but go again by the Gospel side to their place behind the Celebrant and Deacon. The Celebrant, with the Deacon and Master of Ceremonies, follows the others till they arrive at the foot of the body, when they turn towards the Altar. The Celebrant stands directly behind the Bier and in a line with it and not, as at other times, a little to one side. As the Sub-deacon with the Cross is before the Altar, the Celebrant and Deacon, when going round the Bier to asperse and incense the body, do not salute both the Altar and the Cross of the Sub-deacon by separate reverences, but salute the Cross only, as it alone is supposed to be in sight

### II. When the Body is not Present.

If the body be not present, a Catafalque should be erected in the place which the Bier would occupy, if the body were present, and, as usual, lighted candles should be placed on either side. All the ceremonies prescribed in the preceding article will be observed except that the Prayer, *Enter not into judgment*, is omitted and the Office is commenced, so soon as the Celebrant and his Ministers have reached the Catafalque, by the Cantors intoning the opening words of the R/. *Deliver me*, as usual. The relative positions of the various ministers are not changed, although it be customary for the Catafalque to be placed in the Chancel, as it is only when the body of a deceased Bishop or Priest is actually present that the Celebrant and his assistants stand at the end farthest from the Altar and the Cross-bearer and Acolytes between the Catafalque and the Altar.

At the conclusion of the final Prayer, the Celebrant will make the Sign of the Cross over the Catafalque while chanting the words, *Rest eternal*, *grant to him*, *O Lord*. The Choir respond, *And let light perpetual shine upon him*, and the Cantors \[page 103\] sing *May he rest in peace*. The Choir respond Amen and then all retire to the Sacristy, after making the proper reverence to the Altar.

If it be desired, or if from circumstances it be necessary, to make the Absolution in a less solemn manner when the body of a departed person is not present, the Catafalque may be dispensed with and in its stead a Pall or black cloth may be spread at the conclusion of the Requiem Eucharist, on the floor at the foot of the Altar steps. The Celebrant having removed his Chasuble and Maniple at the Sedilia and put on the Cope or simply in Alb and Stole will go to the Epistle side of the Altar, near the Book, as at the Introit.

The R/. *Deliver me*, is sung and while it is being repeated the Celebrant blesses the incense as usual but without leaving the Epistle side of the Altar.

After the blessing of the incense, the Thurifer and Clerk with holy water go to the Gospel side, the Master of Ceremonies remaining at the right of the Celebrant. After saying *Our Father*, the Celebrant passes to the centre of the Altar and with the Master of Ceremonies (on the lower step) still at his right, makes the proper reverence, and then turns towards the Pall. The Master of Ceremonies receives the sprinkler from the Clerk with holy water and afterwards the Thurible from the Thurifer and presents them in turn to the Celebrant, who first sprinkles and then incenses the Pall three times, first to the middle, then to his left and lastly to the right, the Master of Ceremonies holding up the Cope, if it be worn. The Celebrant returns to the Epistle side and facing the Altar, sings the remaining Versicles and Prayers; after which he goes to the centre, makes the proper reverence, and accompanied by his assistants returns to the Sacristy, in the usual way. When the service is performed in this manner the Processional Cross will not be required and the Acolytes will not carry lighted candles.

### III. Of the Order of the Service.

*The Priest standing at the foot of the body of the departed person, will say:*

ENTER not into judgment with Thy servant, O LORD, for in Thy Sight can no man living be justified. Judge him not therefore, O LORD, whom the prayers of the faithful commend unto Thee, but of Thy mercy let him who, when alive, was signed in the Name of the HOLY TRINITY, escape Thy just vengeance. Who livest and reignest, world without end. *Amen*.

*The foregoing is omitted if the body of the departed person be not present.*

R/.. Deliver me, O LORD, from death eternal in that day tremendous: when the Heavens and the earth shall be moved: when Thou comest to judge the world by fire. V/. I am in fear and trembling until the sifting is at hand, and the wrath about to come. \*When the Heavens and the earth shall be moved. V/. That day, a day of wrath, of calamity and misery, a great day, and exceeding bitter. \*When Thou comest to judge the world by fire. V/. Rest eternal grant to them, O LORD, and let light perpetual shine upon them. R/. Deliver me, O LORD,....... by fire.

*During the last* R/. *the Priest blesses the incense in the usual manner.*

*The* R/. *being finished, the Choir, on one side, say,*

LORD, have mercy.

*Those on the other side respond,*

CHRIST, have mercy.

*Then all say together,*

LORD, have mercy.

*The Priest then says in a loud voice*, OUR FATHER, *continuing the Prayer*, *with all the others*, *in an undertone*, *while he proceeds to asperse and incense the body*. *Having returned to his place*, *he says*:

V/. And lead us not into temptation.
R/. But deliver us from evil.

\[page 104\]

V/. From the gate of hell.
R/. Deliver *his* soul, O LORD.
V/. May *he* rest in peace.
R/. Amen.
V/. O LORD, hear my prayer.
R/. And let my cry come unto Thee.
V/. The LORD be with you.
R/. And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

O GOD, Whose nature and property is ever to have mercy and to forgive, receive our humble petitions for the soul of Thy servant N., which Thou hast commanded to pass out of this world: deliver it not into the hands of the Enemy, neither forget it at the last, but command it to be received by Thy holy Angels, and to be carried into the land of the living; and, forasmuch as he hoped and believed in Thee, let him be counted worthy to rejoice in the fellowship of Thy Saints. Through our LORD JESUS CHRIST, Thy SON, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the Unity of the HOLY GHOST, GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.

*If the departed be a Priest*, *in the Prayer should be said*, for the soul of Thy servant and Priest N.

*If the body be not present*, *the following may be said instead*:

ABSOLVE, O LORD, we beseech Thee, the soul of Thy servant (*or* handmaid), N., that though dead to the world, *he* may live to Thee; and whatsoever *he* hath done amiss in *his* human conversation, through the weakness of the flesh, do Thou by the pardon of Thy most merciful loving-kindness wipe away. Through CHRIST our LORD, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the Unity of the HOLY GHOST, GOD, for ever and ever. *Amen*.

*The body is then carried to the grave*, *or if it be not present*, *the Office is thus concluded*:

V/. Rest eternal, grant to *him*, O LORD.
R/. And let light perpetual shine upon *him*.
V/. May *he* rest in peace.
R/. Amen.



[\[1\]](#_ftnref1) If the Ablutions are taken at once, the Master of Ceremonies does not return to the side of the Celebrant until after the last Ablution, he then goes to his right and points out the Communion and the prayers that follow.

[\[2\]](#_ftnref2) The Choir take up the Antiphon before the Psalm from this point. Only the first verse of the Psalm need be sung by the Choir, except the aspersion of the people be made in Procession round the Church.

[\[4\]](#_ftnref4) On the Pall covering the body may be placed the insignia of any special dignity, ecclesiastical or secular, borne by the deceased, for example, if he be a Priest, a violet or black Stole, or if a Bishop, his Mitre. If the departed be a child not over seven years of age, a crown or wreath of flowers may be placed on the Pall, but it is very undesirable to extend this custom as is sometimes done, to all young, unmarried persons, and certainly in all other cases it should be strictly disallowed.

[\[5\]](#_ftnref5) If there be no Cope for the Celebrant, he officiates in Alb and Stole, in which case the Deacon and Sub-deacon will take oft the Dalmatic and Tunicle.
