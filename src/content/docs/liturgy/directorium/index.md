**Directorium Anglicanum
****First edition of 1858**

**Editorial comment**

Scanning the text of this book has presented a number of problems.

1\. The footnotes have subnotes and a substantial portion of the text is included in the footnotes. Most pages are presented in two columns: on the left the main text and on the right the footnotes. The subnotes are placed at the end of each webpage with appropriate hyperlinks. The original division into pages has in general been preserved, except

> a) where a footnote runs onto a second page, the whole footnote has been shown on the initial page,
>
> b) where a word in the main text is hyphenated and split over two pages the whole word is shown on the first page.

2\. The text is printed using the long-s, which my OCR program normally interprets as an f. The OCR program also sometimes has trouble with italics and the ligature ct. Undoubtedly I have failed to correct all the errors so please advise me of any that you find.

3\. Small capitals are shown as normal capitals.

4\. Greek is shown without accents.
