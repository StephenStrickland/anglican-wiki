THE CANON.

ALMIGHTY and ever-living God, who by Thy holy Apostle hast taught us to make prayers and supplications, and to give thanks for all men; We humbly beseech Thee most mercifully to receive these our prayers, which we offer unto Thy divine Majesty, beseeching Thee to inspire continually the universal Church with the spirit of truth, unity and concord; And grant that all they that do confess Thy holy Name, may agree in the truth of Thy holy Word", and live in unity and godly love.

COMMEMORATION OF THE LIVING.

SPECIALLY we beseech Thee to save and defend Thy servant N. our King, that under him we may be godly and quietly governed. And grant unto his whole council, and to all that are put in authority under him that they may truly and indifferently minister justice, to the punishment of wickedness and vice, and to the maintenance of God's true religion and virtue.

Give grace, O heavenly Father, to N., and N., and all Bishops, Pastors and Curates, that they may both by their life and doctrine set forth Thy true and lively Word, and rightly and duly administer Thy holy Sacraments;

And to all Thy people, N. and N., give Thy heavenly grace, that with meek heart and due reverence they may hear and receive Thy holy Word, truly serving Thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of their life. And we most humbly beseech Thee of Thy goodness, O Lord, to comfort and succour all them, who in this transitory life are in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity. And especially we commend unto Thy merciful goodness this congregation which is here assembled in Thy Name, to celebrate the commemoration of the most glorious death of Thy Son.

COMMEMORATION OF THE SAINTS.

AND here we do give unto Thee most high praise and hearty thanks: For the wonderful grace and virtue declared in all Thy Saints, from the beginning of the world: And chiefly in the glorious and most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord and God, and in the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs, whose examples, O Lord, and steadfastness in Thy faith, and keeping Thy holy commandments grant us to follow.

COMMEMORATION OF THE DEAD.

WE commend unto Thy mercy, O Lord, all other thy servants N. and N., which are departed hence from us, with the sign of faith, and now do rest in the sleep of peace; Grant unto them, we beseech Thee, Thy mercy and everlasting peace, and that, at the day of the general resurrection, we and all they which be of the mystical body of Thy Son, may altogether be set on His right hand, and hear that His most joyful voice: Come unto Me, O ye that be blessed of My Father, and possess the kingdom, which is prepared for you from the beginning of the world; grant this, O Father, for Jesus Christ's sake our only Mediator and Advocate.

THE INVOCATION.

ALMIGHTY God, (*the bell is rung once*) our heavenly Father, who of Thy tender mercy didst give Thine only Son Jesus Christ, to suffer death upon the Cross for our redemption, who made there, by His one oblation of Himself, once offered, a full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice, oblation and satisfaction, for the sins of the whole world, and did institute, and in His holy Gospel command us to celebrate a perpetual memory of that His precious death, until His coming again;

Hear us, O Merciful Father, we beseech Thee: and with Thy Holy Spirit and Word vouchsafe to bless + and sanctify + these Thy gifts + and creatures of Bread and Wine, that they may be unto us the Body + and the Blood + of Thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ;

Who in the same night that He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had blessed 4- and given thanks, He brake it and gave it to His disciples, saying: Take, eat;

THIS IS MY BODY WHICH IS GIVEN FOR YOU:

Do this in remembrance of Me. (*the bells arc rung*).

Likewise after supper, He took the Cup, and when He had given + thanks, He gave it to them, saying: Drink ye all of this: FOR THIS IS MY BLOOD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT WHICH IS SHED FOR YOU AND FOR MANY, FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS:

Do this, as oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of Me. (*the bells are rung*.)

THE OBLATION.

WHEREFORE, O Lord and heavenly Father, according to the Institution of Thy dearly-beloved Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ, we Thy humble servants, do celebrate + and make + here + before Thy divine Majesty, with these + Thy holy + gifts the memorial which Thy Son hath willed us to make: having in remembrance His blessed Passion, mighty Resurrection and glorious Ascension, rendering unto Thee most hearty thanks, for the innumerable benefits procured unto us by the same.

Entirely desiring Thy Fatherly goodness mercifully to accept this our Sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving: most humbly beseeching Thee to grant, that by the merits and death of Thy Son Jesus Christ, and through faith in His Blood, we and all Thy whole Church may obtain remission of our sins and all other benefits of His passion.

And here we offer and present unto Thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and bodies to be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto Thee: humbly beseeching Thee, that whosoever shall be partakers of this holy Communion may worthily receive the most precious Body + and Blood + of Thy Son Jesus Christ and be fulfilled + with Thy grace and heavenly benediction, and made one body with Thy Son Jesus Christ, that He may dwell in them and they in Him.

And although we be unworthy, through our manifold sins, to offer unto Thee any sacrifice: yet we beseech Thee to accept this our bounden duty and service, and command these our prayers and supplications, by the ministry of Thy holy Angels to be brought up into Thy holy Tabernacle before the sight of Thy divine Majesty; not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences through Christ our Lord;

By Wh + om, and with Wh + om, in the un + ity of the Holy Ghost, all honour + and glory + be unto Thee,

*At the end of the Canon, the Priest says or sings*,

V. O Father Almighty, world without end.

R. Amen.

And now, O Father, mindful of the love
That bought us, once for all, on Calvary's Tree,
And having with us Him that pleads above,
We here present, we here spread forth to Thee
That only Offering perfect in Thine eyes,
The one true, pure, immortal Sacrifice.

Look, Father, look on His anointed Face,
And only look on us as found in Him:
Look not on our misusings of Thy grace
Our prayer so languid, and our faith so dim;
For lo! between our sins and their reward
We set the Passion of Thy Son our Lord.

*or*

Wherefore, O Father, we Thy humble servants
Here bring before Thee Christ Thy well beloved,
All-perfect Offering, Sacrifice immortal,
Spotless Oblation.

See now Thy children, making intercession,
Through Him our Saviour, Son of God incarnate,
For all Thy people, living and departed
Pleading before Thee.

*Priest alone*.

Let us pray.

As our Saviour Christ hath commanded and taught us, we are bold to say:

Our Father, &c.
V. And lead us not into temptation:
R. But deliver us from evil.
V. World without end.
R. Amen.

V. The peace + of the Lord + be always + with you.
R. And with thy spirit.

THE AGNUS DEI.

*This is said or sung by Priest and People*.

O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us (*or at a requiem*, grant them rest.)
O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us (grant them rest.)
O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, grant us Thy peace (grant them rest eternal.)

THE COMMUNION.

*When the bell is rung at the communion of the Priest, those of the people who wish to communicate, should go up to the Altar step, men and boys going first*.

*Each person should genuflect, or kneel on the right knee, on coming out of his or her seat*.

THE CONFESSION.

*This is led by the server and said by all who are to receive Communion*.

ALMIGHTY GOD, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things, Judge of all men: We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness, Which we from time to time most grievously have committed, By thought, word, and deed, Against Thy Divine Majesty, Provoking most justly Thy wrath and indignation against us. We do earnestly repent, And are heartily sorry for these our misdoings; The remembrance of them is grievous unto us; The burden of them is intolerable: Have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, most merciful Father; For Thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, Forgive us all that is past; And grant that we may ever hereafter serve and please Thee in newness of life, To the honour and glory of Thy Name. Through Jesus Christ Our Lord. Amen.

THE ABSOLUTION.

THE PRAYER OF HUMBLE ACCESS.

WE do not presume to come to this Thy Table, O merciful Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in Thy manifold and great mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under Thy Table. But Thou art the same Lord, whose property is always to have mercy: Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of Thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink His blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by His body, and our souls washed through His most precious blood, and that we may evermore dwell in Him, and He in us. Amen.

Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only, and Thy servant shall be healed.

I worship Thee, Lord Jesus,
And kneeling unto Thee,
As Thou didst come to Mary,
I pray Thee come to me.

My Jesus I believe that Thou art truly present in this Holy Sacrament.

I adore Thee, I love Thee.
I am very sorry that I have offended Thee.
Come to my poor soul and unite Thyself to me.

*Pause and make the sign of the Cross*.

I thank + Thee, O Jesus.
O never, never leave me. Amen.

O Saving Victim, opening wide
The gate of heaven to man below,
Our foes press on from every side,
Thine aid supply, Thy strength bestow.

All praise and thanks to Thee ascend
For evermore Blest One in Three;
O grant us life that shall not end
In our true native land with Thee. Amen.

*The Ablutions are now taken*.

THE COMMUNION SENTENCE.

V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.

THE POST-COMMUNION.

*The Prayer of Thanksgiving*:

ALMIGHTY and everliving God, we most heartily thank Thee, for that Thou dost vouchsafe to feed us, who have duly received these holy mysteries, with the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of Thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ; and dost assure us thereby of Thy favour and goodness towards us; and that we are very members incorporate in the mystical body of Thy Son, which is the blessed company of all faithful people; and are also heirs through hope of Thy everlasting kingdom, by the merits of the most precious death and passion of Thy dear Son. And we most humbly beseech Thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with Thy grace, that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do all such good works as Thou hast prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without end.

O Jesu, Lord, remember
When Thou shalt come again
Upon the clouds of heaven,
With all Thy shining train.
When every eye shall see Thee,
In Deity revealed,
Who here upon this Altar
In silence art concealed;
Remember then, O Saviour,
I supplicate of Thee,
That here I bowed before Thee
Upon my bended knee;
That here I owned Thy Presence,
And did not Thee deny;
And glorified Thy greatness
Though hid from human eye.
Accept, Divine Redeemer,
The homage of my praise;
Be Thou the Light and Honour
And Glory of my days.
Be Thou my Consolation
When death is drawing nigh;
Be Thou my only Treasure Through all eternity. Amen.
