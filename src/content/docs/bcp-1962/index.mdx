The 1962 Book of Common Prayer is the prayer book of the Anglican Church of Canada. It replaced the 1918 Canadian prayer book and remains the last traditional-language Book of Common Prayer produced by the Canadian church. Still authorized for use alongside the *Book of Alternative Services* (1985), the 1962 book holds a distinctive place in the Anglican Communion as a careful revision within the classic prayer book tradition.

The Canadian 1962 book draws heavily on the English 1662 BCP but incorporates notable revisions of its own. Among the most significant changes from the 1918 book were a revised Psalter, additional collects, epistles, and gospels for use throughout the church year, and expanded provision for occasional offices. The book also includes prayers for the Sovereign and for Canada reflecting the distinct character of Canadian Anglicanism within the wider Communion.
