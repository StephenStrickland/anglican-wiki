\[NOTICE PREFIXED TO THE SIXTH EDITION OF DR. SHERLOCK'S "PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN."\]

MR. HOLLAND,

I SEND you a short account of Dr. Sherlock's life. If you think fit you may prefix it to his "PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN," which you are going to reprint. This account might easily have been enlarged, but then it would not have been so agreeable to the character and modesty of the Doctor, who always declined being known any more than he was obliged by the duties of his calling; so that the blessing of a most exemplary life was confined, for the most part, to the limits and observations of one single parish.

That primitive method of devotion, which you are going to reprint, will need not better recommendation than the good acceptance of the former impressions; which, together with the testimony of those who know the advantage of observing the stated hours of prayer, will encourage you to hope that your undertaking may benefit both yourself and many others. I heartily wish it may do so, and remain

Your affectionate friend,

THOMAS SODOR AND MAN.

ISLE OF MAN.
*Sept*. 23, 1712.
