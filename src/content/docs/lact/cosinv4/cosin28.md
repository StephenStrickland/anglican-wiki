3\. Do you, the Churchwardens and Sidemen, take diligent care, and see who of your parishioners be absent from the divine service, and sermon in your Church or Chapel upon Sundays and Holidays? And, if you find any to have absented themselves without a sufficient cause, do you, by warrant from some of the justices of peace, levy of them (by way of distress upon their goods) the sum of twelve pence for every such day of their absence, according to the Act of Parliament in that case provided? And do you distribute the several sums so levied among the poor of your parish, according to the law?

Are you careful, that none of them sit, lean, or lay their hats, upon the Communion Table? Do you permit no minstrels, no morris-dancers, no dogs, hawks, or hounds, to be brought or come into your Church, but set your Sexton to keep them out, that the Congregation, and the Minister performing divine service, or preaching his sermon, may not be disturbed by them?

8\. Have you (the Churchwardens and Sidemen now sworn to give in a true answer unto all these articles of enquiry in all their several titles) has a sufficient time to draw up your presentments, and therein consulted or entreated your Minister for his faithful assistance?

For you know assuredly, that, as the true discharging of your office is the chief means whereby public disorders, sins, and offences in your parish, may be reformed and punished, so, if you wilfully refuse to present such crimes and faults, as either you know to have been committed, or otherwise have heard of them by public fame,—that, in such cases, the Bishop and his officers are to proceed against you in their ecclesiastical courts, as in cases of wilful omission and perjury.
