*Preface to the 1912 re-issue Edition*

> The reader will see at once that this little book could not have been written had I not been permitted to borrow freely from many larger volumes. My warmest thanks are due first of all to Miss Church, without whose consent I could not have undertaken my task; to Messrs. Macmillan for their generous permission to borrow freely from Church's *Life and Letters*, as well as from his published writings, especially *The Oxford Movement*; to Messrs. Longman for similar leave to quote from *The Beginning of the Middle Ages*; and to Mr Edward Bellasis and Mr Wilfrid Ward for the extracts they have allowed me to make from the *Apologia pro Vita Sua*, and from *William George Ward and the Oxford Movement*.
>
> In this edition I have made a few corrections, and added in an appendix two letters of the Dean's to myself, one on the Royal Supremacy, the other on the Old Catholics.
