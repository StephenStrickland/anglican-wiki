THE AUTHOR OF
FATHER POLLOCK AND HIS BROTHER
HAS RECEIVED THE SUBJOINED LETTER FROM
BISHOP GORE.

*

Bishop's Croft.
Birmingham, September 9, 1911,

Dear ——,

I have not time at present to read through Your Memoir of the Brothers Pollock, but I have often thought that there ought to be some memoir of them and their work here. They seem to me to have made a real impression on the imagination of Birmingham, and to have been powerful pioneers in spiritual work among us. I have been struck with the many instances in which, since I have been bishop here, individuals—mostly men—have told me of the change in their lives which these true Evangelicals brought about, not so much by their words as by their self-sacrificing lives. I suppose that their strength lay in their whole-hearted love of individual souls. I do not think that they regarded themselves as political or municipal reformers, but the words of "Father Tom," which you quote on page 50, are memorable words—they supply the right motive for real social reform, and they are as much needed to-day as they were when they were written. I wish your Memoir all success.

Believe me to be, yours truly,

C. BIRMINGHAM:
