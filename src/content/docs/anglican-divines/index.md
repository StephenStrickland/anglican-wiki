The Anglican Divines are the theologians, bishops, and scholars whose writings have shaped Anglican doctrine and identity from the Reformation onward. Their works articulate the distinctive Anglican approach to theology: rooted in Scripture, informed by the early Church Fathers, and expressed through reason and the liturgical life of the Church.

## John Jewel (1522–1571)

Bishop of Salisbury and author of the *Apology of the Church of England* (1562), the foundational defence of the Elizabethan Settlement. Jewel argued that the English Reformation was not an innovation but a return to the faith and practice of the primitive Church.
