**Notes**

1     This story was told me in the early 60's by Fr H W Becker, at that time Rector of St John's as a story passed down in the parish.

33     Retreat Day Address given to the SSJE in Cambridge on December 13, 1986, and a subsequent conversation with me.

34     Letter from the Archives, Cambridge, no date or place written, but likely to be from the period in Philadelphia becasue of the mention of Fr Maturin, who returned to England after working in Philadelphia.  He eventually became a Roman Catholic priest and died in the sinking of the Lusitania.

35     Woodgate, M V, Father Benson:  Founder of the Cowley Fathers, London, Bles, 1953.  This is the only biograpy of Fr Benson and it is essentially undocumented.  A M Allchin's article in Smith, Benson of Cowley is more useful in leading one toward the sources, which are few, mostly brief acounts of what is remembered of Benson.  Miss Woodgate does cover the ground well, however, and I have relied on her account.

36     "Clapham Sect," Cross, F E, and E A Livingstone, Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 2nd edition, London, Oxford University Press, 1974, p 297, and "William Wilberforce, p 1479.

37     Benson, Letters, p 229, dated 8-8-1858.

38     cited from Stewart, Andrew B, R M Benson and the Society of St John the Evangelist, AB Honors Thesis, Harvard College, 1979.  Andrew is now Brother Columba Stewart OSB of St John's Abbey, Collegeville, MN.

39     Woodgate, op cit, p 57.

40     This contention is based on Woodgate's description of the makeup of the parish in Fr Benson of Cowley, which I will cite later in this paper, and on verbal communication with Fr Martin Smith SSJE, editor of the excellent and recent Benson of Cowley, and a man who knows the work of Benson quite thoroughly.  In any case, I feel that the matter needs further investigation to determine who the people were who swelled the Cowley St John section of Oxford in the eighteen-seventies, as this might make it possible to add nuance to our understanding of Benson's work and theology.

41     Franklin, op. cit.

42 This is the thesis of Franklin, R W, "Pusey and Worship in Industrial Society." Worship, 57, no 5, September 1983, pp 386-412.

43 St John's Home is now the place where aged Cowley dads in England go to die when the community can no longer care for them.  The current new work of the All Saints Sisters is Helen House, the first pediatric Hospice program.  The traditon continues; the American SSJE served to receive American donations to build Helen House.

44 Cowley St John Parish Magazine, January 1874, no page number.  I think that this unsigned article is from the pen of Benson on two grounds, first, that both as Vicar and as a leader of the London Mission he is describing he would have written the article himself, and second, that it **sounds** like Benson.

Dr Franklin, through his courses taught as a Visiting Professor at the Harvard Divinity School, has been a considerable influence not only on my thinking about Fr Field, but in my choice of Fr Field as a research subject.
