LETTERS TO A YOUNG PRIEST

March II, 1890
MY DEAR SON IN CHRIST:

You are getting a number of calls. I think some one whom I have disappointed, must put up others to call you. My own counsel is to follow Abraham's choice and not Lot's, to prefer the wilderness with Moses than the riches of Egypt. To let God do His work through you and not seek to do your own or any one's. For by these many calls, I see God has a purpose for you here, which it is in the interest of some other powers to hinder. What it is I know not now. God will surely show it, if we go on together. I know the field is poor, and may look barren, but here is the opportunity for the miracles of faith. With all my heart I believe God has a purpose for those devoted Catholics who will stand by me, and if we do not desert our posts, we shall do a work in a few years which will be a blessing to the whole church. Please tell your correspondent, you prefer to stay here with me.

I will give you notice of my visit before long. How I should like to see you. May our Dearest Lord bless you and yours,
Ever faithfully your father and Bishop,
C. C. GRAFTON.

FOND DU LAC, Tuesday, November 19, 1892

MY DEAR SON IN CHRIST:

You had better decline taking part in the union service on Thanksgiving Day. I want to cultivate a friendly relationship with our Christian brethren. There will be other opportunities and ways of doing this. I have, when a Presbyter, taken part in services on certain occasions, where ministers of other religious bodies were present. One reason why I would not go out of my own church on Thanksgiving Day is that the church has appointed a special service for that day. It is not like some National Day, appointed by the state, when with obvious propriety all Christian teachers might come together, but a Festival appointed by the church to be kept whether the state appoint it or not, and with its own office, and you want to teach your own people their duty concerning it.

If there is a Fourth of July service, or the opening of a school, or anything connected with the state or town, there would be no such objection. And as you have a matter to settle with your Presbyterian friends, I think you should decline.

Yours faithfully, etc.,
C. C. GRAFTON,
FOND DU LAC.

PROVIDENCE, November 10, 1895

MY DEAR SON IN CHRIST:

I should advise the penitent you speak ofto save regularly and to put it in some one's keeping for the purpose of restitution. When his purpose was proven by regularity of paymentand had been listedthen to give formal absolution.

When sayhalf had been raisedthen if you had control of the money, to let some one, either the priest or some other priest, go to the Insurance people and pay it, either making terms, or not, as it might seem best. He need not go to the same Company.

Yours in Christ,
C. C. FOND DU LAC.

FORT PIERCE, FLORIDA, Saturday, 22nd

MY VERY DEAR SON:

May our Blessed Lord be your comfort and consolation. The dear little one has been saved from so much. The good Lord has adopted him into his own school of development. He has made him a playmate about the steps of His throne.

Do not be troubled about me. I think I will stay on about two weeks, and then go elsewhere. I am well cared for. My cold hangs on and does not improve.

Do not come hither. This east coast is windy and weather is such that colds are easily taken and hard to get rid of. We have often fire both in morning and evening.

I have the service to-morrow. Don't come to this east coast. I wonder if it is warm anywhere.

With my love and blessing to you and Mrs.,
C. C. FOND DU LAC.

39 Riverside, Monday

MY DEAR SON IN CHRIST:

My stay East has been prolonged, not, I hope, without benefit to the Diocese and the Cause.

I have spoken to the C. B. S. and Catholic Club in these Eastern towns and go to-day to Providence.

Tuesday and Wednesday there are meetings and services of the Catholic Club in Boston, and I am to be present.

Yesterday wrote a short article for the Churchman on the retaking of our proper name. It was inspired by Bishop Doane's address. Did you see the vote of his convention? It was ninety to twenty-one in favor of a change of name.

Next Sunday I am to be present by invitation of Bishop Tikhon at the consecration of the new Russian Orthodox Church here in New York. Then have taken passage on the following Monday for Fond du Lac.

Yours with all Blessings,
C. C. FOND DU LAC.

FOND DU LAC, WISCONSIN, July I, 1911

MY DEAR SON:

Thanks for your note on board ship. We have and shall continue to pray for you daily.

There is a Rt. Rev. Dr. Beals in England, whom possibly you may come across. He was formerly a Roman priest, joined the old Catholic Bishop Matthews, was consecrated a Bishop by him. Broke with him, I believe, on account of his (Bishop Matthews') attitude toward the English Church. He has applied to me for position and work. I have no place to give him and should be afraid to accept him and introduce him as a Bishop in our country.

I pray God to protect you in body and soul, and give you loving wisdom and grace, and forward all your work for Christ in His church.

Your father in Christ,
C. C. FOND DU LAC.
