ANALYSIS OF MEDITATIONS ON THE HOLY GHOST

Come, Lord Jesus, dwell in Thy servants, in the fulness of Thy strength, in the perfection of Thy ways, in the holiness of Thy Spirit, and rule over every hostile power in the might of Thy Spirit and the glory of Thy Father.

 INTRODUCTION
The Holy Ghost lost by the First Adam, Restored in the Second

 I. THE LIFE OF MAN IN THE FIRST PARADISE, THE SHRINE OF HOLINESS.

1\. The body radiant with light.
2\. The soul indwelt by the Holy Ghost.
3\. The access to God in love.

II. THE EXPULSION OF MAN FROM PARADISE, WHEN BEREFT OF THE HOLY GHOST THROUGH SIN.

1\. The sacrilege of the primal disobedience.
2\. The merciful withholding from the "Tree of Life.
3\. The Cherubim barring the way.
4\. Death the only escape from the dominion of Satan.
5\. It must be death to sin, not death in sin; the death of a being who, by perfect obedience and love, makes death a victory.

III. THE RESTORATION OF MAN TO PARADISE AND THE RETURN OF THE HOLY GHOST TO FIND HIS HOME IN MAN.

1\. The tradition of man's home, lost, but not forever.
2\. The veil before the Holy of Holies.
3\. The blood dashed against the Cherub-wings in vain.
4\. The rending of the veil when "on the Cross death died." The living Blood.
5\. As souls of believers under the Old Covenant or the New pass on through the death of Christ, the Holy Ghost returns to dwell in them in mighty power.
6\. We have "right to the Tree of Life"; the Angels are round about us, as we ascend, with Jesus, the Eternal Throne.

The Holy Ghost coming to us from our Lord at the Right Hand of the Father

 I. OUR LORD WENT TO THE FATHER, FOR THAT IS WHERE HE BELONGS.

1\. In our ascended Lord we behold the true "dignity of human nature."
2\. All the purposes of God are to be accomplished through the Sacred Manhood of our Blessed Lord.
3\. Our Lord gives Himself to us that we may rise and ascend with Him to the Father.

II. OUR ESCAPE FROM THIS WORLD IS BY DEATH.

I. Our Baptism "of water and of the Spirit" was "a death unto sin and a new birth unto righteousness."
2\. Our Absolution is a setting of the Cross between us and our sin.
3\. Our Communions are a sharing in the Life victorious over death.

III. WE BELONG TO A KINGDOM THAT IS NOT OF THIS WORLD OR FOR THIS WORLD.

1\. If we are on our way to the Father the world will be against us.
2\. The Church on her course showers blessings even on her enemies, but she is not a great therapeutical institution or a socialistic reform.

The Holy Ghost Convincing Us of the Sin which is Within Us

I. THE LOVE OF THE SPIRIT AWAKING US TO OUR OWN PERSONAL SINS.

1\. The moral law a fact of immediate consciousness. To break it brings uneasiness, not penitence.
2\. Positive laws a fact of experience; but laws deal with sinful acts, not with sinfulness.
3\. When God reveals Himself to the soul a new relation emerges. Then sin involves treachery and unbelief.

II. THE HOLY GHOST PIERCING US WITH FEAR AND SHAME.

1\. Our Lord's Ideal for each of us.
2\. What it is to disappoint our Lord.
3\. Penitence the foundation of all holiness within us. No true penitence without joy.

III. THE HOLY GHOST NEVER CONVINCES US OF SIN WITHOUT POINTING US TO A SAVIOUR FROM ITS GUILT AND POWER.

1\. The worst consequence of sin is sinfulness.
2\. Our Lord has felt the horror of sin that we may learn to hate it.
3\. True penitence, leading to pardon through the Precious Blood, opens the way for the Holy Ghost to accomplish in us the full purpose of His Love.

The Holy Ghost Carrying us forward from the Life of Earth into the Life in Heaven

 I. LOVE OF SELF FOR SELF.

1\. Not a matter of commandment but of instinct, the instinct of self preservation.
2\. Natural love of kindred and neighbors is the extension of love for self into a wider sphere.

II. LOVE OF GOD FOR SELF.

1\. We rise from stage to stage by pain, the pain of unsatisfied desire, love takes the way of the Cross.
2\. As we ask for higher things we gain them.

III. LOVE OF GOD FOR GOD.

1\. "We give thanks to Thee for Thy great glory." We love God because we find Him so worthy to be loved. We love Him for His own sake.
2\. This life but the prologue to the next.
3\. The joys of Heaven the result of the sufferings of earth.

IV. LOVE OF SELF FOR GOD.

1\. Self-love emerges, but transfigured and fit for Heaven.
2\. God's delight in His redeemed.
3\. The Misereres of earth pass into the endless Alleluia in Heaven.

The Holy Ghost Witnessing to the Final Victory of the Church

I. EVERY EUCHARIST A PROPHECY OF THE TRIUMPH OF THE SAINTS.

1\. The tragedy of Mt. Calvary becomes the marriage feast of joy.
2\. Our Lord's *Actus Caritatis*  for

(a) The repairing of the wounded majesty of His Father.
(b) The salvation of sinners.
(c) The sanctification of the faithful.

II. EVERY GOOD COMMUNION A SHARING IN THE GLORY OF THE RESURRECTION.

1\. Our lives to be a continuation of the Easter festival.
2\. Our Lord unites us with Himself to present us to the Father, and work through us for the souls that He loves.
3\. Making our communions with a definite expectation of conquest over sin.

III. DEVOTION TO THE BLESSED SACRAMENT.

1\. The value of a "special devotion" to develop piety.
2\. The ritual of faith and the ritual of love.
3\. The Eucharist a social act, an anticipation of the mutual love of the redeemed in Heaven.
