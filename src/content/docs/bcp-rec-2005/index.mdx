The Book of Common Prayer according to the use of the Reformed Episcopal Church was approved by the General Council in 2005. This edition represents a major revision rooted in the Church of England's 1662 Book of Common Prayer, with elements drawn from the American 1928 Book of Common Prayer and earlier REC prayer books. It replaced the previous 1963 edition, which had descended from the REC's original 1874 prayer book — itself a revision of the 1785 Proposed Book of the Protestant Episcopal Church. A supplementary modern language edition of the services was approved for use by the 53rd General Council in June 2011.

The Reformed Episcopal Church was founded in 1873 by Bishop George David Cummins as an evangelical alternative within the Anglican tradition, and is today a founding jurisdiction of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA).
