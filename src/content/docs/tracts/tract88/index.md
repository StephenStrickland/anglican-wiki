### THE GREEK DEVOTIONS OF BISHOP ANDREWS, TRANSLATED AND ARRANGED.

I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem;
Which shall never hold their peace day nor night.

#### Advertisement.

THE only deviation in the following Translation from the order of the original text, as we have it, has been in the case of such portions of it as are obviously without or out of place., These have been inserted into the main course of the Prayers, or collected together, or, if repetitions, omitted. No alterations have been made in the text itself, and all transpositions are noted as they occur.
