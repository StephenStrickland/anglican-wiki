TO THE FOUNDRESS
OF
THE SOCIETY OF THE HOLY TRINITY
AND OF
THE COMPANY OF THE LOVE OF JESUS,
AND, UNDER GOD,
THE RESTORER, AFTER THREE CENTURIES,
OF
*THE RELIGIOUS LIFE IN THE ENGLISH CHURCH*,
WITH THE PRAYER
THAT THE WORK OF LOVE FOR SOULS
WHICH SHE HAS SO MANIFOLDLY DESIGNED,
AND IN WHICH SHE HAS SO UNCEASINGLY LABOURD,
MAY BE TO HER ENDLESS BLISS AS TO THE GLORY OF
*THE REDEEMER*,
AND THAT THE PRAYERS
WHICH SHE HAS CAUSED TO BE MULTIPLIED
MAY RETURN INTO HER OWN BOSOM.
