Appendix.

THE subjoined address will not be without interest, in relation to the subjects discussed in the Preface. It has since received the adhesion of more than 2000 clergymen.

To HIS GRACE THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY.

Your Grace has been pleased to invite those of the Clergy, who feel dissatisfied or alarmed at the present circumstances of the Church, to state what they desire, in the way of remedy. Encouraged by this invitation, we venture to submit to your Grace the following suggestions.

First of all, and especially, we would respectfully express our desire for a distinctly avowed policy of toleration and forbearance, on the part of our Ecclesiastical Superiors, in dealing with questions of Ritual. Such a policy appears to us to be demanded alike by justice and by the best interests of religion. For justice would seem to require, that, unless a rigid observance of the Rubrical Law of the Church, or of recent interpretations of it, be equally exacted from all the parties within her pale, it should no longer be exacted from one party alone, and under circumstances which often increase the difficulty of complying with the demand. And, having regard to the uncertainties which have been widely thought to surround some recent interpretations of Ecclesiastical Law, as well as to the equitable claims of Congregations placed in the most dissimilar religious circumstances, we cannot but think that the recognized toleration of even \[85/86\] wide diversities of ceremonial is alone consistent with the interests of true religion, and with the well-being of the English Church at the present time.

The immediate need of our Church is, in our opinion, a tolerant recognition of divergent Ritual practice; but, we feel bound to submit to your Grace that our present troubles are likely to recur, unless the Courts by which Ecclesiastical causes are decided, in the first instance and on appeal, can be so constructed as to secure the conscientious obedience of Clergymen who believe the constitution of the Church of Christ to be of divine appointment; and who protest against the State's encroachment upon rights, assured to the Church of England by solemn Acts of Parliament. We do not presume to enter into details upon a subject, confessedly surrounded with great difficulties; but content ourselves with expressing an earnest hope that it may receive the attention of your Grace, and of the Bishops of the Church of England.

We are,

Your Grace's very obedient Servants,
