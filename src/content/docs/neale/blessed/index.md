Preface

IN the teaching and practice of Dr Neale, as founder of S. Margaret's Sisterhood, the Blessed Sacrament occupied from the first a place of paramount dignity; and while as yet daily Celebrations and Offices in honour of the Holy Eucharist were almost unknown among English Catholics, he taught his Sisters to worship with fervent, vigorous love and reverence, and gave them the fullest opportunities of Sacramental worship and Communion.

They consider, therefore, that the Sermons he has left on this subject bear a peculiar interest; and having gathered them together, they offer them for the use of others. They do not pretend to set forth this scanty collection as a full course of instruction, which indeed it is not; but they do hope that it may prove an assistance to devotion, and to a deepened insight into the depths of Scriptural and Liturgical mysteries concerning this great subject.

The Sermon last in order was published in the first edition, only, of the First Series of "Readings for the Aged."
