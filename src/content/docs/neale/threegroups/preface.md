PREFACE.

FEW words of preface are needed for this volume. It contains, as its title states, groups, not perfect sets, of Sermons on three subjects. Those on the Apocalypse and the Virtuous Woman were partly preached in regular course: those on the Holy Name, at many different times. The latter have been gathered together here, because the subject has a peculiar interest for all persons connected with this Sisterhood; and the Litany, daily used by all its members, and frequently alluded to in these Sermons, is appended to them.

The principle which actuates the Sisters of S. Margaret's in editing their Founder's works, was sufficiently set forth in the Preface to "Sermons on the Psalms;" and, while they regret the almost necessary imperfection of posthumous publications, they trust that this little book may not prove useless or uninteresting to those for whose use it is offered.
