PREFACE.

I HAVE

**always felt that there ought to be some especial reason why papers, which have served their turn in a periodical, should be collected into a volume.

I may remark that the Essays, which the reader is about to peruse, are, in their nature, (for the most part,) rather successive chapters of one work, than scattered papers in a quarterly review. In the latter, they appeared rather by necessity, than by choice, of order. Perused, as they were to be, at such a distance of time from each other, an amount of recapitulation was sometimes necessary, which rendered the Dissertation in which it occurred the heavier reading; while, after all, it could not be expected that the student, in giving his attention to an Essay of this quarter, should be able to revert to the same subject in a number of the Review which might be two or three years old.

In the present volume the various papers have been arranged in proper order; reiterations, no longer **\[vi\]** necessary, have been cut out; some mistakes have been rectified; some criticisms have, I hope, been profited by; and the result is now before the reader.

I might also, in excuse for their republication, plead the urgent requests which I have received from scholars, both in England, Germany, and Russia, by whom it is an honour to be referred to, that these Essays should appear in a separate form: and I may mention that some of them have been translated into French, German, Romaic, and Russ.

This volume consists, almost entirely, of papers furnished to the *Christian Remembrancer.* I have to thank the editor not only for his permission to republish them, but also for his acceptance of Dissertations which to the majority of his readers must have been, for the most part, uninteresting; and which could only be really acceptable to the small class of Liturgical students among us.

I have also to thank my friend, the Rev. Gerard Moultrie, for his addition to the paper on Liturgical Quotations in the New Testament: where he has most happily—unless partiality deceives me—worked out-with regard to the Isapostolic Fathers,—the idea which had been in my Essay started with respect to the writings of the. New Testament. I have endeavoured to adduce additional proof in favour of a theory which I am the more encouraged to consider important on account of the very great kindness with which it was received in Germany.

In addition to those papers which are reprinted from **\[vii\]** the *Christian Remembrancer,* one—that on the Bollandists—was a contribution to the *Ecclesiastic:* only, when it was originally written, I had not myself enjoyed, as I have since, the privilege of visiting their house of S. Michael, at Brussels; and this has occasioned some addition to the original account.

And, finally, the Dissertation on Sequences is reprinted because it is not procurable in England, while it has been quoted as of some degree of authority in Germany. The first draught was prefixed as an Introduction to the collection of Sequences which I printed in 1851**.** Dr. Daniel, the first hymnologist of the day, being about to add a fifth volume, by way of appendix, to his former labours—a volume dedicated to Proses alone—requested leave to reprint that Introdu6tion. I was unwilling that, after the lapse of six or seven years, it should appear without corrections and additions; and the result was the Epistle which the reader has now before him.

How utterly unworthy of their subject these Dissertations are, no one can feel more deeply than I do. Yet, at the same time, they were, I believe, the first attempt to elucidate Comparative Liturgiology which had appeared in the English language, (Mr. Freeman’s invaluable work having not been published when most of them were written),—a fact which may perhaps be allowed to excuse some of its shortcomings.
