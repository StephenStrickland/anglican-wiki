PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

The following little work was, I believe, the first which, of late years, maintained the supernatural view of the subject of which it treats.

Since the publication of the First Edition, Mrs. Crowe's *Nightside of Nature* has appeared. Those who differ as entirely as I do from its religious theories, must yet cheerfully own its deep interest, its extended research, and its great ability. As it is so easily procurable, I have contented myself with here and there referring to it, instead of quoting from it.

> Nov. 11, 1853.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

> The following little book makes no pretence at being a systematic treatise on the subject on which it treats; its aim is to set forth Christian views on a point of popular belief which writers have generally considered worthy of ridicule or pity, or at least susceptible of a natural explanation.
>
> With respect to stories hitherto unpublished, the writer has related none which he has not good grounds for believing; and he has endeavoured to state, in each particular account, the degree of evidence by which it is supported.
>
> He ought, perhaps, to state, that he never saw Mr. Dendy's very interesting *Philosophy of Mystery* till he had almost concluded his own work. He has inserted, in different places, a few striking relations from it.
