Songs and Ballads for the People

By the Rev. John Mason Neale

London: James Burns, 1843.

VIII. God speed the Plough!

> The teams are waiting in the field,
> The ploughmen all a-row;
> As brisk and gay as birds in May,
> They make a goodly show.
> The farmer stands, and sees all hands
> Turn'd out and ready now;
> Yet ere they start, with all our heart
> We'll say, God speed the plough!
>
> We plough the field; but He must yield
> His sunshine and His rains:
> In hope we plough, in hope we sow,
> That He will bless our pains.
> 'Tis even weight, and furrow straight,
> That bears away the bell;
> So off! And now God speed the plough,
> And send the ploughman well!
