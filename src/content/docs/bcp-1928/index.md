The 1928 Book of Common Prayer served the Episcopal Church for fifty years, from 1928 until 1978. This revision was among the most extensive in the history of American prayer books. Changes from the previous 1892 book included combining three baptism rites into one, further deemphasis of the Decalogue in the Communion service, and rearranging the Lord's Prayer and the Prayer of Humble Access back to the position they held in the Prayer Book of 1549.
