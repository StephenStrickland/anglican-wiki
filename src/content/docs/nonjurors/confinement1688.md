The Confinement of the Seven Bishops.

\[London: no publisher, 1688\]

> Where is there Faith, or Justice to be found?
> Sure, the World Trembles, Nature's in a sound,
> To see her Pious Sons, Design'd to Fall,
> A Victim, for Religion, Truth and All.
> The Charms of Piety, are no Defence,
> Against the New found Power, that can Dispense
> With Laws, to Murder Innocence:
> Surely, unless some Pittying God look down,
> And stop the Threatning Torrent, it will drown
> Divinity it Self.--------------
>           The Bishops Prisoners are, we tamely see;
> The Reverend Prelats forc'd to Bow the Knee
> To Anti-Christ: No, Mighty Monarch, know,
> Tho' we must pay to Caesar what we Owe;
> There is a Power Supreme, by which You Live,
> Whose Arm is longer, and Prergoative
> Larger by far, than Yours, whose very Word
> Can blast Your Hopes, and turn Your two edg'd Sword;
> Can make this Titular Vice-gerent know,
> Vertue, like Palm's Deprest, do's higher grow.
> Tho' Roab'd in all the Grandure of the State,
> Courtiers, like Radient Stars about You wait,
> Midst of Your Glorious Joys, when You put on
> That Awful Presence, which becomes a Throne:
> *Belshazzer* like, Three Words upon a Wall,
> 'Twill Dash Your Joys, and make Your Glory Fall:
> His Holyness, That Patriot of Strife,
> Tho' he can grant You Pardon, cannot Life.
>           Arise then, Mighty Sir, in God-like Mean!
> As of thy Valor, Let thy Truth be Seen,
> Free from Mistrust, let all Your Words be clear
> By Action; Let Your Promises appear,
> Protect the Church, which brought You to the Crown;
> You know 'tis Great, and Honourable to Own,
> A Kindness done; But to Reward with Death,
> The Happy instruments, That gave You Breath,
> Is mean; and might a Catholick Conscience sting,
> To cut the Hand of that, Anoints You King.
